            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MAny writings, and ſermons alſo have cauſe to wiſh that the men from whom they come were leſſe knowen then they are. For then ſhould they bee free from much prejudice, and finde better accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with thoſe that they come to. But I wiſh nothing more unto this Treatiſe, which now is comming into the world, then that the Author of it were throughly known unto all thoſe that ſhall meet with it; for then his worke would need no borrowed commendation, the title it ſelfe carrying autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with it, even to force reſpect from every honeſt Reader, if either the ſharpneſſe of wit, variety of reading, depth of judgement, aptneſſe to teach, holy and pleaſant language, heavenly converſation, wiſe cariage, or any fulneſſe of grace will ſo farre prevaile with him. I doe not abuſe good words, or load one with them whom they doe not belong to, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny painters of Sepulchres in their funerall Orations uſe to doe: but ſpeak that in ſhort, which M. Baines his perſon did largely preach unto all ſuch as came neere unto him: and that which his incomparable writings will ſufficiently witneſſe to future generations.</p>
            <p>Neither is this all that the Authours qualitie may ſuggeſt unto the conſiderate Reader: but he may ariſe from this to more important thoughts; eſpecially if the remembrance of M. Baynes his worth doe occaſion him to thinke of many others like unto him: ſuch as M. Deering, M. More, M. Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, M. Perkins, M. Rogers, M. Cartwright, M. Fenner, M. Brightman, M. Parker, M. Philips, M. Hieron, &amp; M. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw &amp;c. to ſpeake nothing of thoſe which yet liue, nor of D. Reinolds, D. Fulk, and D. Whitakers with many others. For all theſe being apprehended as men agreeing in one ſpirit, and having had indeed the ſpirit of glory reſting on them, as their workes doe ſhew, together with thoſe letters teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
<pb facs="tcp:2189:3"/>
which they left written in the hearts of many thouſand Chriſtians, it muſt needs cauſe at the leaſt an inquirie, what the reaſon ſhould be, that ſuch famous men of God, could never like well of our Biſhoply courſes in England, nor ever be favoured of them. The caſe is plaine to all: and the cauſe is as evident to thoſe that haue eyes to ſee: but no where more apparant then in the perſon of M. Baines, and the place where hee, and others like him were made ſignes of this antipathie. Cambridge is or ſhould be, as an eye to all our land: ſo that the alterations that fall out there cannot but bee felt of all parts. It is the place of light; the ſpirituall oppreſsions which in other corners are covered with darkeneſſe (as all the works of darkneſſe would be) when paſt all ſhame they come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the Sunne it ſelfe, how can they then be hidden?</p>
            <p>When M. Perkins had there for many yeares held forth a burning and ſhining light, the ſparkes whereof did flie abroad into all corners of the land, and after he had ſerved his time was taken up into heaven, there was none found ſo meet for to receive, as it were, the torch out of his hand, and ſucceed him in that great office of bearing it before ſuch a people, as this M. Baines, upon whom alſo the ſpirit of that Elias, was by experience found to be doubled. In this ſtation he ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned himſelfe for ſome years, that impietie onely had cauſe to complaine: for all that favoured the wayes of God, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and gloried in him and his Miniſterie, as a ſpirituall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But at length the howre of darkneſſe came from Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, when Arch. Bancroft ſent M. Harſenet to viſite, as they call it, that is (if termes may be interpreted by common practiſe) to picke the purſes of poore men, and to ſuppreſſe thoſe that are not friends to the Biſhops Kingdome. For though in that circuit there were a multitude of unable and notoriouſly ſcandalous Miniſters, yet none were found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of cenſure, but onely M. Baynes, of whom the world was not worthy, and one other Preacher like unto him. Now it is hard to ſay, whether the ſilencing of him was more odious, or the manner of it ſhameleſſe. There muſt be a Sermon (yee know) at ſuch viſitations, for faſhion ſake, though the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelfe can ſeldome find leaſure to make it. This part was
<pb facs="tcp:2189:3"/>
therefore appointed to M. Baynes by the Viſiters, that he might either be inſnared in his words, if he did not apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to their humours, or elſe grace their ungracious cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, if he did. But it did not ſucceed handſomely either way: For he delivered wholeſome doctrine appertaining to the preſent audience, in ſuch warie manner, that no ſpecious occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion could be taken thereby of queſtioning his libertie. Yet fairely or fouly the miſchievous intention muſt not faile. M. Baines having heat his weake body by ſtraining to ſpeake unto a great audience, retired himſelfe preſently upon his comming down from the Pulpit to provide for his health, which otherwiſe would have bene indangered. They in the meane time going on with their buſineſſe, as they are wont in the maſterly forme of a muſter, called for M. Barnes among the reſt, and upon his not anſwering, though he was not cited thither as to a Court, but onely intreated to preach, as hee did, yet for not appearing, he was immediately ſilenced. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in deed, the Chancellour being informed of that groſſe nullitie, which was in that ſentence, urged him about ſubſcription and conformitie; and ſo to make ſure worke, ſilenced him over againe: In which buſineſſe he was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious unto himſelfe of unreaſonable and ridiculous dealing, that when M. Baynes ſtanding to receive the ſentence of a corrupt man, did lift up his heart and eyes unto God with a heavenly ſmiling countenance, as he uſed, he interpreted that geſture to be a skorning of his authoritie. This being done, M. Baines was perſwaded by his friends to try the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops courteſie, unto whom, when he preſented himſelfe, at the very firſt ſalutation, the gravitie and ſeveritie of B. Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft led him ſharply to rebuke the good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a little black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke, which was upon the edges of his cuffes, asking him how he durſt come before him with ſuch cuffs, telling him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry biſhoplike, that it were a good turne to lay him by the heeles for ſo doing. After this he would have no more to doe with ſuch abſurd unreaſonable men: but preached ſometime where he might have libertie, as his weakeneſſe of bodie would ſuffer; and ſpent the reſt of his time in reading, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, praying and writing, ſaving that upon occaſion he did
<pb facs="tcp:2189:4"/>
inſtruct or comfort thoſe which came to him in private, wherein he had a heavenly gift. He was indeed all his life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, beſide the weakeneſſe of his bodie preſſed with want, not having (as he often complained to his friends) a place to reſt his head in: which me thought was an upbraiding of the age and place where he lived with baſe regardleſſneſſe of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and learning: yet he never ſo much as conſulted with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of denying his ſinceritie by pleaſing the Biſhops, of whom and their courſes he was wont to ſay, <hi>They are a generation of the earth, earthly, and ſavour not the waies of God.</hi> Which ſaying of his, they, and ſome Doctors of Cambridge have ſince made good, in that they could not indure, that the place from whence they thruſt him, ſhould be ſupplyed by other honeſt men, though they were conformable, but with abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie at length forbad it, alledging that Puritanes were made by that lecture: whereas the truth is, that one lecture hath done more good to the Church of God in England, then all the doctors of Cambridge: though I doe not deny, but ſome of them have wrought a good worke.</p>
            <p>By this one inſtance (of which kind I would there were not a hundred in our land) it may eaſily appeare to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Reader, that there is as much agreement betwixt our Biſhops in their managing of Religion (except ſome two or three, which went out of their elements, when they vente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on thoſe places) and thoſe powerfull Preachers who haue bene the chiefe meanes of revealing Gods arme unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as there is betwixt the light which commeth down from heaven, and that thick miſt which ariſeth from the loweſt pit.</p>
            <p>But we need not ſeeke for demonſtrations of the ſpirit which worketh in our Hierarchie from this oppoſition, look but at the fruits of it, where it hath all fulneſſe of conſent, as in Cathedrall Pallaces, or Pariſhes of Biſhops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops reſidence, ſuch as Lambeth is, where all their canons are in force, and haue their full ſway without contradiction: nay come neerer unto them, and take a view of their families, even to them that wayt in their chambers, and ſee what godlineſſe there is to be found. Haue there not more of God and his Kingdome appeared in ſome one Congregation of
<pb facs="tcp:2189:4"/>
thoſe Miniſters which they haue ſilenced for unconformity, then in all the Biſhops families that are now in England? Was there ever any of them that could endure ſuch a Pariſh as Lambeth is, if they had ſuch power of reforming it as the Archbiſhops haue?</p>
            <p>To returne therfore unto our Authour: whilſt he lived a private life, being thus ſtrucken with the Biſhops Planet, he had time to apply his able wit and judgement unto the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſsing of many queſtions, which if the Prelates had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſuch leaſure upon him, it may be he would haue paſſed by with others. And among the reſt, by Gods providence hee vvas directed to theſe Eccleſiaſticall Controverſies which concerne our Dioceſan ſtate in England: wherein, as in all other queſtions which he dealt in, he hath ſhewed ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and pearcing underſtanding, together with evidence of truth, as cannot but give good ſatisfaction to him that in theſe things ſeeketh light.</p>
            <p>He might in deed have choſen other particular corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to have vvritten on, if it had bene his purpoſe either to haue taught men, vvhat they daily ſee and feele, or to haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured about the branches, and leaue the root untouched: But it vvas no delight unto him, for to proue that vvhich no man doubted of, as that the common courſe and practiſe of our Prelates their courts, their urging of ſubſcriptions, with humane ſuperſtitious ceremonies, are preſumptuous inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies againſt God and his Church: or prepoſterouſly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne at the end of the ſtreame for to cleanſe the vvater. He choſe rather to ſearch the fountaine of all that foulneſſe vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith our Churches are ſoiled: vvhich he judged to be found in the conſtitutions here in this Treatiſe examined. And if theſe fevv queſtions be vvell conſidered, it vvill appeare that a multitude of pernicious abuſes doe depend on thoſe poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vvhich in them are confuted. One fundamentall abuſe in our Eccleſiaſticall oppreſsion is in the diſpoſing of charges, or placing of Miniſters over Congregations: It is called u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually beſtovving of Benefices or Livings, in an earthy phraſe vvhich ſavoureth of the baſe corruption commonly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For Congregations ought not to be beſtovved on Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
<pb facs="tcp:2189:5"/>
but Miniſters on Congregations: the benefit or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the miniſter, is not ſo much to be regarded, as of the Congregation: It is the calling and charge which every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſhould looke at, not his living and benefice. Now theſe Benefices are beſtowed ordinarily by the Patron (whether Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, prophane, or religious, all is one) and the Biſhop, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard of the peoples call or conſent: ſo as no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mariage is made; no ſervant placed: againſt all Scripture, Councels and ancient examples. Whereby it commeth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to paſſe, that Lawyers muſt determine of Miniſters cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, after long ſuits and great charges; as if Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Farmes were held by one title and right. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it is found that the Miniſter is a continuall plague unto his people, living in contention, ſpight and hatred with them, as many law-ſuits doe too too plainely witneſſe. What is the reaſon? Becauſe Pariſhes are eſteemed as no Churches, that ever were ordeined by Chriſt, or recived any power and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges from him, but as mans creatures, and by man to be ordered as it pleaſeth him. Another practiſe of like nature with the former, is that the Miniſter being called to one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, becommeth a Pluraliſt by taking another, or more livings, in ſpight of that Congregation, to which hee was firſt and is ſtill perſonally tied. And after all this he may be a non-reſident, abiding or preaching at none of his many livings. Nay he may chop and change, ſell and buy like a marchant, ſo he doe it cloſely; which is ſuch an abomination, as Rome and Trent condemneth, and hell it ſelfe will ſcarſe defend. What is the ground? Becauſe (forſooth) Chriſt hath not appointed Pariſhes, their officers, and offices, and therfore no man is bound further in this kinde, then mens Lawes, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, cuſtomes, and injunctions doe preſcribe unto them. For a grave Doctor of Cambridge anſwered one that queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him for his groſſe non-reſidencie, <hi>viz.</hi> that Pariſhes were divided by a Pope: inſinuating as it ſeemeth that he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it a point of Poperie, for to tie Miniſters unto their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular charges,</p>
            <p>A third groſſe corruption is, that the officers in Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Miniſters, Church-wardens, &amp;c. are made ſervants to
<pb facs="tcp:2189:5"/>
the Biſhops, Chancellours, Archdeacons, &amp;c. being, as it were, their promotors, informers, and executioners, in all matters of juriſdiction and government, for to bring in money into their purſes: for performance alſo of which ſervice to them, the Church-wardens upon every occaſion are enforced to take ſuch corporall oathes as not one of them doth ever keep. What other ground of this, beſide the fore-mentioned, that particular Congregations are no ſpirituall incorporations, and therefore muſt have no officers for government within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
            <p>Now all theſe confuſions with many other of the ſame kinde, how they are condemned in the very foundation of them, M. Baines heere ſheweth in the firſt queſtion, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the divine conſtitution of a particular Church, in one Congregation. In which queſtion he maintaineth againſt his adverſaries a courſe not unlike to that which Armachanus, in the daies of King Edward the third, contended for againſt the begging Friers in his booke called <hi>The Defence of Curates</hi>: For when thoſe Friers incroached upon the priviledges of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall Miniſters, he withſtood them upon theſe grounds: <hi>Eccleſia Parochialis juxta verba Moſis Deut. 12. est locus electus a Deo, in quo debemus accipere cuncta quae praecipit Dominus ex Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis. Parochus eſt ordinarius Parochiani: est perſona a Deo prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta, vel mandato De<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ad illud ministerium explendum electa:</hi> Which if they be granted, our adverſaries cauſe may goe a begging with the fore ſaid Friers.</p>
            <p>Another ſort of corruptions there are, which though they depend upon the ſame ground with the former, yet immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately flow out of the Hierarchie. What is more diſſonant from the revealed will of Chriſt in the Goſpell, even alſo from the ſtate of the Primitive Church, then that the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt ſhould be managed as the Kingdomes of the world; by a Lordly authoritie, with externall pompe, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding power, contentious courts of judgement, furniſhed with chancellours, officials, commiſſaries, advocates, proctors, paritors, and ſuch like humane deviſes? Yet all this doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow upon the admitting of ſuch Biſhops as ours are in England: who not onely are Lords over the flock
<pb facs="tcp:2189:6"/>
but doe profeſſe ſo much in the higheſt degree, when they tell us plainely, that their Lawes or Canons doe binde mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. For herein wee are like to the people of Iſrael, who would not have God for their immediate King, but would have ſuch Kings as other Nations: Even ſo the Papiſts, and we after them, refuſe to have Chriſt an immediate King in the immediate government of the Church; but muſt have Lordly Rulers with ſtate in Eccleſiaſticall affaires, ſuch as the world hath in civill.</p>
            <p>What a miſerable pickle are the moſt of our Miniſters in, when they are urged to give an account of their calling? To a Papiſt in deed they can give a ſhifting anſvver, that they have ordination from Biſhops, which Biſhops were ordained by other Biſhops, and they, or their ordeyners by Popiſh Biſhops: this in part may ſtop the mouth of a Papiſt: but let a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant which doubteth of theſe matters move the queſtion: and what then will they ſay? If they flie to popiſh Biſhops, as they are popiſh, then let them goe no longer masked under the name of Proteſtants. If they alledge ſucceſſion by them from the Apoſtles, then (to ſay nothing of the appropriating of this ſucceſsion unto the Popes chaire, in whoſe name, and by vvhole authority our Engliſh Biſhops did all things in times paſt) then I ſay they muſt take a great time for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfying of a poore man concerning this queſtion, and for the juſtifying of their ſtation. For untill that out of good records they can ſhew perpetuall ſucceſsion from the Apoſtles unto their Dioceſan which ordained them, and untill they can make the poore man which doubteth, perceiue the truth and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of thoſe records (which I wiſſe they will doe at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) they can never make that ſucceſsion appeare. If they flie to the Kings authoritie, the King himſelfe will forſake them, and denie that hee taketh upon him to make or call Miniſters. If to the preſent Biſhops and Arch-biſhops, alas they are as farre to ſeeke as themſelues, and much further. The proper cauſe of all this miſery is the lifting up of a lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prelacie, upon the ruines of the Churches liberties.</p>
            <p>How intollerable a bondage is it, that a Miniſter being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a charge, may not preach to his people except he hath
<pb facs="tcp:2189:6"/>
a licence from the Biſhop or Arch-biſhop: Cannot receiue the beſt of his Congregation to communion if he be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſpirituall Courts, though it be but for not paying of ſixe pence which they required of him in any name, be the man otherwiſe never ſo innocent: nor keep one from the communion, that is not preſented in thoſe Courts, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſented is for money abſolved, though he be never ſo ſcandalous: and muſt often times (if he will hold his place) againſt his conſcience put back thoſe from communion with Chriſt, whom Chriſt doth call unto it (as good Chriſtians if they will not kneele) and receive thoſe that Chriſt putteth backe, at the command of a mortall man.</p>
            <p>What a burthen are poore Miniſters preſſed with, in that many hundreds of them depend upon one Bitſhop and his Officers: they muſt hurrie up to the ſpirituall Court upon every occaſion, there to ſtand with cap in hand, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Biſhop, but before his Chancellour, to be railed on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times at his pleaſure: to be cenſured, ſuſpended, deprived, for not obſerving ſome of thoſe Canons, which were of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe framed for ſnares, when far more ancient and honeſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons are every day broken by theſe Iudges themſelues for lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre ſake, as in the making of Vtopian Miniſters, who haue no people to miniſter unto; in their holding of commendams, in their taking of money, even to extortion, for orders and inſtitutions: in their ſymonie, as well by giving as by taking: and in all their idle, covetous, and ambitious pompe? For all theſe and ſuch like abuſes, we are beholding to the Lordli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our Hierarchie: which in the root of it, is heere overthrowen by M. Bayne in the concluſions of the ſecond and third Queſtion. About which he hath the very ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, that Marſilius Patavinus in part undertooke long ſince, about the time of Edward the ſecond, againſt the Pope.

            <head>THE FIRST QVESTION IS WHETHER CHRIST DID INSTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVTE OR THE APOSTLES frame any Dioceſan forme of Churches, or Pariſhionall onely.</head>
            <p>FOR determining this Queſtion, we will firſt ſet down the Arguments which affirme it. Secondly, thoſe which deny. Thirdly, lay down ſome reſponſiue concluſions, and anſwer the objections made againſt that part we take to be the truth.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who affirme the frame of Dioceſan Churches, vouch their Arguments: partly from Scripture: partly from preſidents, or inſtances ſacred and Eccleſiaſticall. Finally, from the congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it hath with reaſon, that ſo they ſhould be continued.</p>
            <p>The firſt objection is taken from comparing thoſe two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Titus 1.5. Act. 14.23. <hi>Ordaine Elders Citie by Citie. They or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Elders Church by Church.</hi> Hence it is thus argued. They who ordained that a Citie, with the Suburbs and region about it, ſhould make but one Church, they ordeined a Dioceſan Church. But the Apoſtles, who uſe theſe phraſes as aequipollent, <hi>To ordaine Preſbyters in every Citie,</hi> and <hi>to ordaine them in every Church,</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that a Citie, with the ſuburbes and region about it, ſhould make but one Church. Ergo, the Apoſtles conſtituted a Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Church.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of the propoſition is, becauſe Chriſtians converted in a Citie, with the ſuburbes, villages, and countries about it, could not be ſo few, as to make but a Pariſhionall Church. The Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is cleere, for theſe phraſes are uſed, as <hi>ad aequate,</hi> and being ſo uſed, needs it muſt be that the Apoſtles framed Cities, ſubburbs, and regions into one Church.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:2189:8"/>2 They argue from examples: Sacred and Eccleſiaſticall. Sacred are taken out of the old and new Teſtament. Eccleſiaſticall, from the Primitiue times, and from Paternes in our owne times: yea, euen from ſuch Churches, is we hold reformed, as thoſe in Belgia and Geneva.</p>
            <p>To beginne with the Church of the Iewes in the old Teſtament, whence they reaſon thus. That which many particular Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues were then (becauſe they were all but one Common wealth, and had all but one profeſſion) that may many Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches now be upon the like grounds. But they then, though many Synagogues, yet becauſe they were all but one Kingdom, and had all but one profeſſion, were all one nationall Church. Ergo, upon like grounds many Churches with us, in a Nation or Citie, may be one Nationall or Dioceſan Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Church of Ieruſalem in the New-teſtament is objected. 1 That which the Apoſtles intended ſhould be a head Church to all Chriſtians in Iudea, that was a Dioceſan Church. But this they did by the Church of Ieruſalem. Ergo: 2. That which was more numberſome, then could meet Pariſhionally, was no pariſhionall but Dioceſan Church. But that Church was ſuch. Firſt, by growing to 3000, then 5000, Act. 2.41. &amp; 4.4. then to haue millions in it, Act. 21.20. Ergo, the Church of Ieruſalem was not a Pariſhionall, but a Dioceſan Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Church of Corinth is objected to haue bene a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan Church. He who writing to the Church of Corinth, doth write to all the Saints in Achaia with it, doth imply, that they were all ſubordinate to that Church. But this doth Paul, 1. Cor. 2.1. Ergo. Secondly, He who ſaluteth jointly the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians and Achaians, and calleth the Church of Corinth by the name of Achaia, and names it with preheminence before the reſt of Achaia, doth imply that the Church of Corinth was the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan Church to which all Achaia was ſubject. But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth this, 2 Cor. 9.2. &amp; 11.11.8.9.10. Ergo.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that which was the mother Citie of all Macedonia, the Church in that Citie muſt be, if not a Metropolitan, yet a Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Church. But Philipi was ſo. Ergo.</p>
            <p>The fifth is from the Churches of Aſia, which are thus proved, at leaſt to haue bene Dioceſan. 1 Thoſe ſeven Churches which conteyned all other Churches in Aſia ſtrictly taken, whether in Citie or Countrey, thoſe ſeven were for their circuit, Metropolitan, or Dioceſan Churches. But thoſe ſeven did conteine all other in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia. Ergo. 2 He who writing to all Churches in Aſia, writeth by name, but to theſe ſeven, he doth imply, that all the reſt were conteyned in theſe. But Chriſt writing to the ſeven, writeth to all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2189:8"/>
Churches in Aſia, not to name that two of theſe were Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan Cities, viz. Philadelphia, &amp; Pergamus, ſeates Dioceſan at leaſt. 3 He who maketh the ſingular Church he writeth to, to be a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Churches, not one onely (as the bodie is not one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber onely) he doth make that one Church, to which he writeth in ſingular, to be a Dioceſan Church. But Chriſt in his Epipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nematicall concluſion to every Church, which he had ſpoken to in ſingular, doth ſpeak of the ſame as of a multitude. <hi>Let him that hath cares, heare, what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches.</hi> Ergo</p>
            <p>Thus leaving Sacred examples, we come to Eccleſiaſticall.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in regard of thoſe ancient Churches, Rome, Alexandria. It is impoſſible they ſhould be a Pariſhionall Congregation 200 years after Chriſt. For if the multitude of Chriſtians did in Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem ſo increaſe within a little time, that they exceeded the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion of one Congregation, how much more likely is it that Chriſtians in Rome and Alexandria did ſo increaſe in 200 years, that they could not keep in one particular Aſſembly. But the firſt is true. Ergo, alſo the latter. Which is yet further confirmed by that which Tertullian and Cornelius teſtifie of their times.</p>
            <p>To come from theſe to our moderne reformed Churches, theſe proue a Dioceſan Church. That reſpect which many congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons diſtinct may haue now aſſembled in one place, that they may have ſevered in many places. For the unitie of the place is but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſicke to the unitie of the congregation. But many diſtinct congregations gathered in one Citie Church, may make, we ſay, one Church as they doe in the Netherlands. Ergo, diſtinct congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, ſevered in diverſe places may make one Church. It many Churches, which may ſubject themſelves to the govornment of one Presbyterie, may ſo make one, they may ſubject themſelues to a Biſhop and Cathedrall Conſiſtorie, and ſo make one. But the 24 Churches of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the territories belonging to it, doe ſubject themſelues to the government of one Preſbyterie, and ſo make one. For ſo farre as two meete in a third, they are one in it Ergo.</p>
            <p>The third principall Argument is from reaſon. If Citie Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches onely, and not the Churches of Villages, and Countrie Townes, had Biſhops, Preſbyters, and Deacons placed in them, then were thoſe Citie Churches Dioceſan Churches. But Citie Churches onely had theſe. Ergo, Citie Churches were Dioceſan, diſtinguiſhed from Pariſhionall Churches. The Aſſumption is proved firſt by Scripture, Titus 1.5. Act. 14.23. Secondly, this is proved by Eccleſiaſticall Storie. They who are given to labour the converſion of the Regions, rather then tend thoſe already converted, they were not given to a Pariſhionall Church. But the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2189:9"/>
Preſbyters planted by the Apoſtles were ſo. Ergo. They who were ſet in a Church before Pariſhes were, could not be given to a Pariſhionall Church. But ſuch were the Preſbyters of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles inſtitution, Ergo. For it is plaine in the practiſe of all ages, from the firſt diviſion, that no Church but the mother Church had a Preſbyterie and a Biſhop, but Preſbyters onely. Nay, it was ever by Councels condemned, and by the judgement of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent forbidden, that in Townes or Villages, any but a Preſbyter ſhould be planted. 3 This is alſo proved by reaſon, for it was no more poſſible to haue Biſhops &amp; Preſbyters in everie Pariſh, then to haue a Maior and Aldermen (ſuch as we haue in London) in every Town. 2 If everie Pariſh had a Preſbyter, then had they power of ordination, and furniſhing themſelues with a Miniſter, when now they were deſtitute. But they were alwaies in this caſe dependant on the Citie. Ergo, there was then a Dioceſan Church having governement of others. Preſbyters could not ordeyne: <hi>ſede vacante,</hi> though they did at firſt, as in the Church of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria. Let any ſhew for 400 yeares a Pariſhionall Church with a Preſbyterie in it.</p>
            <p>Now we muſt muſter thoſe forces which oppoſe theſe Dioceſan Churches, allowing onely ſuch Churches to be inſtituted of Chriſt, which may meet in one Congregation ordinarily.</p>
            <p>The word which without ſome modification ſuper-added, doth ſignifie onely ſuch a company as called forth, may aſſembly Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, that word being alone, doth ſignifie ſuch a Church as may to holy purpoſes ordinarily meete in one. But the word <hi>Church,</hi> which Chriſt and his Apoſtles did inſtitute, is uſed indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, and ſignifieth no more. Ergo. <hi>Vbi lex non diſtinguit, non eſt diſtinguendum.</hi> 2 The Scripture ſpeaketh of the Churches in a Kingdome or Province, alwaies in the plurall number, without any note of difference, as equall one with the other. Ergo, it doth not know Provinciall, Nationall, or Dioceſan Churches. Let a reaſon be given, why it ſhould never ſpeak in the ſingular number, had they bene a ſingular Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let us come to examples: the Churches the Apoſtles planted were ſuch as might and did congregate.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that of Hieruſalem, though there were in it toward 500 <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues,</hi> yet the Chriſtian Church was but one, and ſuch as did congregate into one place ordinarily after the acceſſe of 5000 to it. Act. 2.46. &amp; 5.12. &amp; 6.1. &amp; 15.25. &amp; 21.22. &amp; 25.22. For their ordinarie meeting, as it is, Act. 2.46. <hi>daily,</hi> could not be a Panege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall meeting. Againe, if they might meet Synodically, why might they not meete then in daily courſe; though the univerſall meeting of a Church is not ſo fitly called Synodicall: And though
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2189:9"/>
they are ſaid to be millions of beleevers, yet that was by accident of a circumſtance, happily the Paſſeover. We muſt not judge the greatneſſe of a water by that it is, when now it is up and ſwelleth by accident of ſome inundations. They had not a ſetled ſtate there, by which they did get the right of being ſet members. Yea, it is likely, they were and continued but one congregation. For 40 yeares after they were not ſo great a multitude, but that <hi>P<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lla,</hi> like to the <hi>Zohar</hi> of Lot, a little Towne could receiue them. But more of this in the anſwer to the objection.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſo the Church of Antiochia, was but one church. Act. 14.27. they are ſaid to haue gathered the Church together. Ob. That is the Miniſters, or repreſentatiue Church. Anſ. 1 For Miniſters onely the Church is never uſed. 2 By analogie, Act. 11. Peter gave account before the whole Church, even the Church of the faithfull. Ergo. 3. They made relation to that Church, which had ſent the forth with prayer &amp; impoſition of hands, &amp; this Church ſtood of all thoſe who aſſembled to the publicke ſervice and worſhip of God. 4. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Church of Antioch were gathered together to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of decrees ſent them by the Apoſtles from Hieruſalem. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the church of Corinth was one congregation, which did for the ſervice of God, or exerciſe of Diſcipline meet together. 1. Cor. 5.4. 1. Cor. 14.25. ver. 26. 1. Cor. 11.17. ver. 23. <hi>in uno &amp; eodem loco.</hi> That whole church which was guiltie of a ſinner uncaſt forth, could not bee a Dioceſan church, neither can the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>comming together,</hi> ever be ſhewed to ſignifie any thing elſe, beſides one particular Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the church of Epheſus was but one flocke. Firſt, it is likely that it was of no other forme then the other. Secondly, it was but one flock; that flock which Preſbyters might jointly feed, was but one. They had no Dioceſan Paſtour. If Preſbyters onely, then none but Pariſhionall Churches in and about Epheſus. There may be many flocks, but God ordained none, but ſuch as may wholy meete with thoſe, who haue the care of feeding and governing of them. Peter indeed, 1. Pet. 5.2. calleth all thoſe he writeth to, one flocke: but that is in regard either of the myſticall eſtate of the faithfull, or in reſpect of the common nature which is in all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches one and the ſame: but properly, and in externall adunation, one flock is but one congregation. Thirdly, Pariſhes according to the adverſe opinion, were not then divided. Neither doth the long and fruitfull labours of the Apoſtles argue, that there ſhould be Pariſh churches in Dioceſan wiſe added; but a greater number of ſiſter churches. But when it is ſaid that all Aſia did heare: the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2189:10"/>
meaning is, that from hand to hand it did runne through Aſia, ſo as Churches were planted every where, even where Paul came not, as at Coloſſe. There might be many churches in Aſia, and many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by Peter and others fruitfull labour without ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of churches.</p>
            <p>Examples Eccleſiaſticall. 1 Ignatius exhorteth the church of the Epheſians, though numberſome, to meete together often in one place, Epiſt. to the Epheſians, and to the Philippians: where the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop is, let the people be gathered to him, as where Chriſt is, there is the whole hoſt of heaven. He calleth his church of Antioch a Synagogue of God, which cannot agree to a Dioceſan church: For theſe were particular congregations, oppoſed as to that Nationall church, ſo to all Provinciall and Dioceſan. Neither doth he call himſelfe Biſhop of Syria, but as he was, Biſhop of the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Syria, as a Miniſter ſtileth himſelfe a Miniſter of the church of England.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Iuſtine and Ireneus knew no kinde of church in the world which did not aſſemble on the Sabboth. But a Dioceſan church cannot.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Tertullian Apol. cap. 39. doth ſhew that all churches in his time did meet, and did worſhip God, in which prayers, readings, exhortations, and all manner of cenſures were performed.

            <p n="7">7 Biſhops were wont to goe forth to confirme all the baptized through the Dioceſſe.</p>
            <p n="8">8 They were neighbours, and might meet a dozen, ſixe, three, in the cauſe of a Biſhop.</p>
            <p n="9">9 They were united, ſometimes in Provincial Councels, in which many Biſhops met twice yearely, Ruffin. l. 1. c. 6.

Auſtin ſaith there were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable orthodoxe Biſhops in Africa: and the Provninciall Councels doe confirme the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now by reaſon it is cleare that churches were not Metropolitan or Dioceſan.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That church whoſe cauſes are wanting, that church is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. But in a Dioceſan church cauſes are not to be found. Ergo.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the efficient cauſe, God ordeyning. For none can take on him to be a miniſter <hi>Dioceſan</hi>: no place to be a place, where the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly Dioceſan ſhould be held; no people can worſhip God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to this place and miniſtery, without warrant of his word. Ergo. The Nationall church of the Iewes, Aaron and his ſonnes tooke not that honour, it was given them: The place of the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall meeting, God choſe Hieruſalem. The people he preciſely bound to practiſe ſome ordinances of worſhip no where but there, and to appeare there before him. Secondly, the matter of a Dioceſan church is people within ſuch a circuit, obliged to meet at leaſt on ſolemne daies, whereſoeuer the Dioceſan Miniſters and Ordinances of worſhip are exerciſed; Paſtors who haue callings to tend them and miniſter to them in this Dioceſan meeting now aſſembled. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the actuall meetings of them to ſuch end, as ſuch more ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and publike meetings are ordained to, are no where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2189:11"/>
nor in any faſhon were ever by any warrant of the Word practiſed.</p>
            <p>If any ſay, theſe are not the cauſes of a Dioceſan church, but an ordinance of God binding perſons within ſuch a circuit to ſubject themſelues to ſuch a church and the miniſterie thereof, that they may be governed by them.</p>
            <p>I anſwer. Firſt, there is no ordinance of God for this, that can be ſhewed, that churches within ſuch a circuit ſhould be tyed to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine head church for goverment. Nay it is falſe. For every church by Chriſts inſtitution hath power of goverment; and the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue had in ordinarie matters, the government that the Church of Ieruſalem had; (being all over) except onely in ſome reſerved cauſes. Secondly, I ſay, that this will not make a Dioceſan church formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called. As a Nationall church could not formally bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out binding the whole Nation to exerciſe ordinances of worſhip in the head church of it: So by proportion. Yea government is a thing which doth now <hi>accidere</hi> to a church conſtituted, and doth not eſſentially concurre as matter or forme to conſtitute a church of this or that kinde. Againe, were this true, that the Dioceſan Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Miniſters haue onely governement committed to them, then it will follow, that they onely have the governing of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular churches, who are not any way Paſtors of them, miniſtring Word and Sacraments to them. But this is moſt abſurd, that their proper and ordinary Paſtors, who diſpence Word and Sacraments to them, ſhould not haue <hi>poteſtatem pedi,</hi> nothing to doe in governing thoſe flockes which depend on them. If any ſay, they were not <hi>actu,</hi> but they were <hi>virtute potentie:</hi> I ſay, it is alſo to make the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles churches imperfect: and how can this be known but by a preſumed intention, which hath nothing to ſhew it, but that after event of things.</p>
            <p>From the effect I argue.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Thoſe churches which Chriſt did ordeine and the Apoſtles plant, might ordinarily aſſemble to the ordinances of worſhip. But a Dioceſan church cannot ordinarily aſſemble. Ergo. For when God will haue mercy and not ſacrifice, and the Sabboth is for man, hee will not for ever ordaine a thing ſo unequall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, as is the ordinarie aſſembling of a Dioceſan multitude. If any diſtinguiſh the aſſumption, and conſider a Dioceſan as ſhe is in her parts, or as ſhe is <hi>a totum,</hi> ſtanding of her parts now collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſay ſhe may, and doth meete and communicate, and edifie her ſelfe in the firſt reſpect. I anſwer, this is nothing, and doth proue her to be nothing, as ſhe is a Dioceſan Church; <hi>quia quid quid eſt, agit ſecundum quod eſt.</hi> If therefore a Dioceſan Church were a reall Church, ſhe muſt haue the effect of ſuch a Church; to wit,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2189:11"/>
aſſembling, as ſhe is Dioceſan. The Synagogues through Iſrael met Sabboth by Sabboth, but were no Nationall Church in this regard; that is to ſay, as it is a Nationall Church, it had her Nationall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meetings.</p>
            <p>I reaſon thirdly from the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That Church which doth <hi>per ſe,</hi> eſſentially require locall bounds of place, that muſt have locall limits ſet forth of God. But a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan Church doth ſo. Ergo. Whence I thus inferre, He who inſtitutes a Dioceſan Church, muſt needs ſet out the locall bounds of this Church. But God hath not ſet out any local bounds of the Church in the New Teſtament: Ergo, he hath not inſtituted any Dioceſan Church. The propoſition is certain: for this doth enter in the definition of a Dioceſan Church, as alſo of a Nationall. And therefore God inſtituting the Nationall Church of the Iewes, did as in a map ſet forth the limits of that nation. So alſo if he had inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Dioceſan and Provinciall Churches, he would have appointed locall bounds, if not particularlie deſcribed, yet known and certain. But God hath not done this. For the Church of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not thus tied to places; it being ſo with the power of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, that it doth <hi>reſpicere ſubditos</hi> onelie <hi>per ſe,</hi> not <hi>terminos locales.</hi> Civill juriſdiction doth <hi>reſpicere ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> primarilie, the ſubiects on it in the ſecond place. As for that commandement of <hi>appoynting Preſbyters Citie by Citie,</hi> it is too weake a ſparr for this building. Again, that Church which may be ſaid to be in a Citie, is not Dioceſan. But the Churches which the Apoſtles planted, are ſayd to be in Cities. Ergo. If one ſay to the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, they may; becauſe the head Church is in the Citie. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The Churches the Apoſtles planted are taken for the multitude of Saints vnited into ſuch a body Eccleſiaſticall. But the multitude of Saints through a Dioceſſe cannot be ſaid to be in a Citie. Ergo, The ſoule may be ſaid to be in the head, though it be in other parts; and God in heaven. God, becauſe of his moſt infinite and indiviſible nature; And ſo the ſoule, becauſe it is indiviſible, and is as all of it in every part, not as a thing placed in a place containing it, but as a forme in that which is informed by it. But in things which have quantitie, and are part out of another, there is not the like reaſon.</p>
            <p n="4">4 From the adjuncts. That Church which hath no time ſet, wherin to aſſemble, is no Church. I ſuppoſe the ground above, that nothing but union of a Dioceſe in worſhip, can make a Dioceſan church. But this Church hath no time. Ordinarie it cannot have; extraordinarie ſolemnities God hath not commanded. Ergo, there is no ſuch Church. For if it be a reall Dioceſan Church, it muſt haue a reall action according to that nature of which it is. The action formall of a Church indefinite is to meet and communicate in worſhip. Of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2189:12"/>
a Nationall Church, is to meet nationally and communicate in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. If then it muſt meet, it muſt have ſome time ſet down, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie or extraordinarie. But God hath done neither. The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which the Apoſtles planted, were in their times moſt perfect and flouriſhing. But Dioceſan Churches were not: for in thoſe times they were but in <hi>ſeminali</hi> infolded, not explicated, as the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries confeſſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That which maketh Gods diſpenſation incongruous to his miniſters, is abſurd. But a Dioceſan frame of Church doth ſo. Ergo. That which maketh God give his extraordinary gifts to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of churches in the Apoſtles times, when now they had but one congregation, and give ordinary gifts onely when now they had 800 churches under them, is abſurd. But this doth the Dioceſan frame. Ergo.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The churches through out which a Preſbyter might do the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a teaching Preſbyter, and a Deacon the office of a Deacon, were not Dioceſan. But every Preſbyter might miniſter in the word and ſacraments throughout the Church to which he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; ſo might a Deacon tend to the poore of the whole church, whereof he was a Deacon. Ergo, theſe were not Dioceſan. The reaſon of the propoſition is. No Preſbyter can through many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations performe ordinarie miniſterie. In which regard the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non law forbiddeth that Preſbyters ſhould have many Churches, <hi>C.</hi> 10. <hi>q.</hi> 3. <hi>Vna plures Eccleſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e vni nequaquam committantur Preſbytero; quia ſolus per Eccleſias nec officium valet perſolvere, nec rebus earum neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſariam curans impendere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 If God had planted Dioceſan churches, that is, ordeined that all within citie, ſuburbs, and regions, ſhould make but one Dioceſan Church, then may not two Dioceſſes be vnited into one Church, or another Church and Biſhop be ſet within the circuit of a Dioceſan church. But neither of theſe are ſo. The judgement of the African fathers ſhew the one, and the Canon law doth ſhew the other. <hi>p.</hi> 2. c. 16.41. Ergo.</p>
            <p n="7">7 If God appointed the frame of the church Dioceſan ſtanding of one chiefe church, others vnited in ſubjection: then can there not be the perfection of a church in one congregation. But where there may be a ſufficient multitude deſerving a proper Paſtor or Biſhop, requiring a number of Pteſbyters and Deacons to miniſter unto them, there may be the perfection of a church. But in ſome one congregation may bee ſuch a multitude. Ergo.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Thoſe churches which may lawfullie have Biſhops, are ſuch churches as God inſtituted. But churches in Towns, populous Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, have had, &amp; may have their Biſhops. Ergo. This is proved by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> every populous Towne, ſuch as our market townes,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2189:12"/>
and others; yea by a <hi>ſynecdoche,</hi> villages; for there they taught as wel as in Cities. There were Synagogues as well as in Cities. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt them afterward in vnconformitie to Law. The teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of <hi>Zozomen</hi> ſheweth what kinde of congreations were they of which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> teſtifieth. And the fathers of Africa did not require, that a Dioceſan multitude, but a ſufficient multitude, not through every part, for then they ſhould have had to doe in Citie churches, but in that part of the Dioceſſe where a Presbyter onely had ſerved the turne, ſhould have their Biſhop.</p>
            <p>If Dioceſan churches, and provinciall churches be Gods frame, then we had no Churches in Brittaine of Gods frame, before that <hi>Auſtin</hi> was ſent by <hi>Gregorie</hi> the great. But here were churches from before <hi>Tertullian,</hi> after the frame God requireth, at leaſt in their judgements. Ergo.</p>
            <p>Now to come to open the termes, and lay downe concluſions: whether Dioceſan or Pariſhionall Churches were conſtiſtuted.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the word <hi>Church</hi> we underſtand here, not <hi>figuratively</hi>; taken <hi>Metonymically</hi> for the place, Synced. for Miniſters adminiſtring ordinances: but <hi>properly,</hi> for a body politick, ſtanding of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to bee taught and governed, and of teachers and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it may be asked, what is meant by a Dioceſan church? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Such a frame in which many Churches are vnited with one head church, as partaking in holy things, or at leaſt in that power of government which is in the chiefe church, for all the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch or ſuch a circuit. Theſe phraſes of a <hi>Dioceſſe,</hi> a <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> are all ſince the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> yea the two laſt much later. A Dioceſſe ſeemeth from the common-wealth to have been taken up in the Church, from what time Biſhops had Territories, ample demaines, and ſome degree of civill iuriſdiction annexed to them. For a Dioceſſe by the Lawyers, is a circuit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, ſuch as the Romans Praeſidents had: or <hi>active,</hi> an admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of thoſe Prouinces with juriſdiction. <hi>L. unica. c. nt omnes iudices.</hi> And in the Canon law, ſometimes <hi>Provincia</hi> and <hi>Diocoeſis</hi> are uſed promiſcuouſly. <hi>diſt.</hi> 50. <hi>c.</hi> 7. But the ancienteſt uſe of this word was to note the Territory, or Countrey circuit, oppoſed to the Citie. Thus the Countrey churches are called <hi>Diocaeſame Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae, cont. tur. c.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Baptiſmales Eccleſiae</hi> were contra-diſtinguiſhed to Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Theſe had every one a Dioceſſe, and the inhabitants were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Diocoeſani</hi>: theſe churches had a moyite of houſes dwelling in neighbourhood that belonged to them; but at length by a Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche, the whole Church was called a Dioceſſe; though the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts diſpute whether it may be ſo called, ſeeing the Dioceſſe is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2189:13"/>
the meaner part by much, in compariſon of the Citie, and ſhould not give the denomination to the whole. So at length the Biſhop was called <hi>Diocoeſanus</hi> and the Church which had been called <hi>Eccleſia ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitatis, matrix, nutrix, Cathedralis,</hi> grew to be called <hi>Dioceſan.</hi> But here we take a Dioceſan Church for ſuch a head Church, with which all Churches in ſuch a circuit hath reall union, and communion in ſome ſacred things. Now a Dioceſan Church may be put <hi>objective,</hi> that is, for a Church in which are miniſters and miniſterie for the good of the whole Dioceſſe, though they ſhould never aſſemble, as the worſhip in the Church of Ieruſalem was for al Iudea, &amp; profited though abſent. Or it may be put formally for a body politicke, a congregation of beleevers through a Dioceſſe, with the miniſters of the ſame, having ſome reall union and communion in ſacred things. We deny any ſuch Church.</p>
            <p>A Pariſhionall Church may be conſidered <hi>Materially</hi> or <hi>Formally,</hi> Materially, as it is a Church within ſuch locall bounds, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers whereof dwell contiguouſly one bordering upon the other. This God inſtituted not, for it is accidentall to the Church, may <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe</hi> and <hi>adeſſe</hi> a Church remaining one. If a Pariſhionall Church in London ſhould dwell, as the Dutch doe, one farre enough from the other, while the ſame beleevers were united with the ſame go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, the Church were not changed, though the place were altered. Secondly, it is put formally, for a multitude which doe in manner of a Pariſh ordinarily congregate; ſuch Churches, and ſuch onely we ſay God erected.</p>
            <p>Now for ſome concluſions, what wee agree in, then what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 1. Churches of Cities, Provinces, Kingdomes, may bee called Dioceſan, Provinciall, National Churches, as the Churches of the world are called Oecumenicall, yea haply not without warrant of Scripture; As 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. writing to all thoſe diſperſed Churches, ſpeaketh of them ſingularly as of one flock, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, things may be called not onely as they are really in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but according to ſome reſpect of reaſon, under which we may apprehend them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concl.</hi> 2. That there may be a reall Dioceſan, Nationall, or head Church, wherewith others ſhould be bound to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly in word &amp; ſacraments, and in ſome more reſerved caſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their government. This was done in the Church of Iudea. Our men are to ſhie, that feare to come to this propoſition, <hi>de poſſe.</hi> I am ſure our adverſaries will grant us, that our pariſhionall frame might have been ſo conſtituted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 3. That there cannot be ſuch a frame of Church, but by Gods inſtitution. No Miniſters can take this honour, but they muſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2189:13"/>
(as <hi>Aaron</hi>) be called to it. When nothing in nature can have further degree of perfection, then the authour of nature putteth into it; how much more muſt the degree of perfection and eminence in things Eccleſiaſticall, depend on God? Wee may reaſon from the Church of Iudea, as <hi>a pari,</hi> to prove, That there cannot bee ſuch a Church, but that all ſubordinates muſt communicate with the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt head Church in ſome ſacred things, which may make them one Church. Thus there would not have been a Church Nationall of the Iewes, but that all the Nation had union and communion together even in the worſhip and ordinances of worſhip. The men onely went up, ſo the male onely were circumciſed: but the female repreſentativelie went up in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> It is enough if the communion be in government, which all our oppoſites grant neceſſarie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This maketh them rather one <hi>in tertio quodam ſeparibili,</hi> then one Church: governement being a thing that commeth to a Church now conſtituted, and may be abſent, the Church remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Church. The firſt Churches of Biſhops, when now they were divided, did keep all other, who were the Biſhops preſbyters ſtrictly ſo called, and the people alſo in ſome communion with the head Church; for in greater ſolemnities one and other went up thither. See <hi>decret. diſt.</hi> 3. <hi>diſt.</hi> 38.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Concluſ.</hi> We agree in this, that Churches were in their firſt plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either not actually Dioceſan, being one congregation without any other ſubordinate, or if they had any, yet were they imperfect, wanting many parts or members of particular Churches, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them.</p>
            <p>That wherein we contradict one another, is, we affirme that no ſuch head Church was ordained either virtually or actually, but that all Churches were ſingular congregations, equall, independent each of other in regard of ſubjection. Secondly, we ſay, were there a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan granted, yet will it not follow, that Pariſh churches ſhould be without their government within themſelves, but onely ſubject in ſome more common &amp; tranſcendent caſes. As it was with the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues and that Nationall Church of the Iewes, &amp; as it is betwixt Provinciall and Dioceſan Churches. If any ſay there is not the ſame reaſon of a Dioceſan Church &amp; Pariſhionall: for that hath in it all the perfection of a Church. I anſwer, not; taken in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to a Provinciall Church, it is but a part and member, and hath not perfection, no more then a parochiall Church hath, compared with a Dioceſan.</p>
            <p>Now followeth to anſwer the Arguments firſt propoſed.</p>
            <p>To the firſt, I anſwer to the propoſition by diſtinction. Thoſe who ordained that the <hi>Civitas</hi> and <hi>Vrbs</hi> people taken in regard of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2189:14"/>
whole multitude of the one, and locall bounds of the other ſhould make but one Church, they did inſtitute a Dioceſan church. But thoſe who ſo inſtituted a Church in Citie, ſuburbs, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey that their number might bee compared fitly to one congregation, they did not therefore ordaine a Dioceſan Church. Againe to the aſſumption. But thoſe who uſe <hi>Citie by Citie,</hi> and <hi>Church by Church</hi> as equivalent (which the Apoſtles doe) they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that Citie, ſuburbs, and Countrey ſhould make but one Church. I anſwer by the like diſtinction. They who uſe, <hi>Citie by Citie,</hi> people being taken for the whole multitude within the extent of theſe locall bounds, as equivalent with <hi>Church by Church,</hi> they may bee ſayd to have ordained that citie, ſuburbs, and teritories, ſhould make but one Church. But thus the Apoſtles doe not uſe them, as of equall ſignification. For the Citie had a reaſon of an ample continent, the Church of a thing contained. Theſe phraſes are, the one proper, the other metonymicall, and are therefore to bee expounded the one by the other. Hee placed Preſbyters <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, leſt wee ſhould underſtand it of the multitude and locall bounds, it is ſayd in the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles that they placed them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Church by Church: becauſe Preſbyters were not given but to Diſciples and Chriſtians now converted out of the multitude and locall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits wherewith cities were bounded. Secondly, there is an <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate</hi> acception of theſe phraſes <hi>per accidens,</hi> not becauſe the citie and church was to make but one church, but becauſe the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by occaſion of their number, not being then too great, were framed into one church; or becauſe by occaſion there was yet but one church, not becauſe there was to be but one. Now he who thus uſeth them promiſcuouſly, doth imply that one church was as yet conſtituted, not that there was to bee but one through the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of citie, ſuburbs and countrey. Thus likewiſe it is eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to the proofe of the propoſition: For thus the multitude of citizens converted and unconverted, could not bee a church of one congregation, yet the number of thoſe who in citie, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, and territories, were actually converted, was no more then might be ordered into one church, and the Apoſtles framing theſe into one on the preſent occaſion, did not exclude the after conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of any other within the ſame locall bounds.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond Argument: and Firſt, to the objection from the Nationall church of the Iewes. I anſwer, denying the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That the Synagogues being many, made one Church; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were all one kingdome, one poſſeſſion. For thus there was one Occumenicall Church, when the world was under one
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2189:14"/>
Emperour, and of one profeſſion. It is accidentall to the unitie of a Church whether the kingdom be one or no. If Iſraell, when God had divided the kingdome into two, had gone up to Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and kept there communion in the worſhipp of that Church, they had ſtill beene one Church, though two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. If here were as many Kings and Kingdomes as have been in England, ſo many as ſhould belong to one Provinciall Church, ſhould bee one Church, though many Kingdomes. The truth is, they were one Church, becauſe they had union and Nationall communion in the ordinances of worſhip, which were in that one Church to which they all belonged. The high Prieſt was their proper Prieſt, hee made interceſſion for them, bleſſed them, they were not to offer any where, but there. If any think this cannot bee the cauſe, why they were one Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of one high Prieſt, for then ſhould <hi>Aaron</hi> have been as well as <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> a type of Chriſts kingly office. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, there is <hi>Prieſtly</hi> Prelacie and government, as well as <hi>Princely;</hi> They were under <hi>Aaron</hi> in the former regard, in which hee was a ſhadow of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond inſtance of Hieruſalem; wee deny the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. It might bee intended for a head and mother Church in regard of order, and yet not bee a Nationall Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power over others: If it ſhould have been a head, having power accordingly, as it was a mother Church, it ſhould have been head to all the world. Secondly, Wee deny the Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That the Apoſtles ever intended, that it ſhould be a head to Chriſtian Churches through Iudea: as it had been before under the High Prieſt. That conſtitution was typicall, and may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plead for an univerſall Chriſtian Church, then for a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Secondly, there is not the leaſt intimation of Scripture this way. Thirdly, had this Divinitie been knowne, the Fathers would not have ſuffered, that it ſhould have been made a Dioceſan church, and ſubjected to Caeſarea. To the Proſillogiſme. The Church which was ſo numberſome, that it could not meet or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, could not bee a pariſhionall Church. This was ſo. Ergo, &amp;c. To the propoſition I anſwer. That which was by inhabitants, who had <hi>fixum domicilium,</hi> ſo numberſome that it could not meet, I grant it. But ſo this was not; by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent often many others were there <hi>in tranſitu.</hi> Secondly, nay wee read that they did meet ordinarily, as is aboue ſaid, and in that deliberation about which the Church of Antioch did ſend to them, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> affirmeth. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>Vniverſam eam conveniſſe.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2189:15"/>
Luke</hi> affirmeth the ſame. As for that of millions of beleevers, it is certaine, they were not fixed members of this Church. For would <hi>Luke,</hi> who reckoneth the growth of them to 5000. have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed ſo notable acceſſions, whereby they ſay, they grew up to I know not how many thouſands; there is no likelihood. Whether therefore they were ſuch beleevers as are mentioned, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. or whether by occaſion of the Paſſover, or Pentecoſt, or ſuch like feaſt, they were <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> onely there for the preſent. How e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is, there is no likelihood that they were conſtant mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Church. Neverteleſſe, ſay, they were more then could fitly meet, yet might they bee tollerated, as in one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. The Apoſtles ſeeing ſuch times to enſue, wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſhould tranſlate themſelves, and bee diſperſed hither and thither. God letting it grow a while more ranke and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant then ordinary Churches are to bee, becauſe it was <hi>Eccleſia ſurcularis,</hi> many of whoſe branches were to bee tranſplanted in their time. Yea had there been five thouſand ſetled members, we read of ſome ordinarie Auditories, ſpoken to by ordinarie Paſtors, as great; as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> on <hi>Math.</hi> 24. doth ſignifie, to his eſteeme they might be five thouſand that then heard his voyce.</p>
            <p>Touching the third inſtance, As to the firſt reaſon, The propoſition is denyed: for naming the reſt of Achaia with them, doth no more ſignifie the ſubiection of all Achaians, then in the 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.2. naming all Saints in every place, doth ſignifie their ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The ſecond reaſon, hath the ſequell of the propoſition denied: for the contrary is rather true. He who without any note of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence calleth the Church of Corinth by the name of Achaia, hee doth imply that it is but one particular Church, equall with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches in Achaia. To the third, the propoſition is againe denied, That hee that ſpeaketh of all the Churches as one, doth imply a metropolitan Church. For by the firſt concluſion we may ſpeake of things not onely as they are really, but according to any reſpect of reaſon, under which they are apprehended. Again, the aſſumption is falſe: He ſpeaketh not of them as one Church, but as divers Churches in one Province. But it is named and ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others. Ergo. &amp;c. The ſequell is againe denied. For it may be named before other, becauſe it is the moſt illuſtrious and conſpicuous Church; but not becauſe it hath any power over other. Finally, it is too groſſe to thinke, that all in Achaia came to Corinth to be inſtructed and make their contributions, every Church uſing the firſt day of the week when they aſſembled to make their collections within themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:2189:15"/>The fourth inſtance is <hi>Crete</hi>; where the many Churches in that Iland ſo full of Cities are ſaid to be one Church of Crete, whereof Titus was Biſhop. Thoſe manifold Churches which made but one, whereof Titus was Biſhop, thoſe were all one Nationall Church. But the Churches of Crete, as ſaith the ſubſcription, were ſo. Ergo. Anſ. The propoſition might be queſtioned on the ground aboue: but the aſſumption is falſe; proved by a ſubſcription, which is like his proofe, which was brought out of the book after the Revelation. For firſt, they are not in the Syriack teſtament. Secondly, they are not thought of Antiquity ancienter then Theodoret. Thirdly, the ſubſcription is falſe, and moſt unlikely. For had Paul written from Nicopolis, he would haue wiſhed Titus to come to him to Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, where he was for the preſent and meant to winter, rather then haue ſpoken of it as a place from which he was abſent, and whether he meant to repaire.</p>
            <p>The fift inſtance. Phillip. 3. That church, which was in the chiefe citie of all Macedonia, muſt needs be at leaſt a Dioceſan. But the Church of Philippi was ſo. Ergo. This will proue an argument, when Churches muſt needs be conformed to the civill regencie of the Emperour: his foure chiefe Governours called <hi>praefecti praetorii,</hi> his preſidents of Provinces under them, and inferiour Iudges, and Magiſtrates, under theſe in one citie, and the regions of it. But this is an errour giving ground to a Patriarchall and Oecumenicall Church, as well as a Provinciall and Dioceſan. This rule of planting Churches varieth at mans pleaſure: For the Romane Provinces after the people of Rome gaue up their right to the Emperour, were brought all into one, under one head and Monarch, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces haue bene diverſly divided from time to time. From this Monarchie aroſe the Popes plea againſt the Greeke Churches for his Oecumenicall ſoveraigntie. What forme of Churches muſt wee haue amongſt them who never received any ſuch go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, nay any government at all. If I were a Conformitant I ſhould object otherwiſe for a Provinciall Church in Philippi: viz. thus. That Church which had many Biſhops in it could not bee Pariſhionall nor Dioceſan, but Provinciall. For the Provinciall Church hath the Metropolitan and Suffragan Biſhops in it, and no other. But Philippi had ſo. Ergo. But the Propoſition is true one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it is underſtood of Dioceſan Biſhops, not of Pariſhionall Biſhops. Againe, Paul writeth not to the Biſhops in the Church, but in the Citie: Now many Biſhops are not in the Provinciall Citie, though many are in a Provinciall Church.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the churches of Aſia. I anſwer to the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt Syllog. by diſtinction. One church may conteine others, as an example doth conteyne in it a thing exemplified: o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:2189:16"/>
as a head Church doth Churches united in ſubjection to it. Thoſe Churches which conteine all other in the latter ſence, it is true, they were at leaſt Dioceſan: but in this ſenſe the aſſumption is denyed. The ſame anſwer ſitteth the Proſyllog. Hee that writing to theſe, writeth to all other by vertue of their ſubjectionall ſubordination, he doth imply that all others are conteyned in theſe as member Churches under one head. But he who writing to theſe, writeth to all other as exemplified onely in them, he doth not imply any ſuch thing. Now this is manifeſt, becauſe hee writeth to ſeven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: whereas this were ſuperfluous, if Chriſt did intend his letter onely to head Churches conteyning other. For then fiue Churches ſhould haue bene written to onely, ſeeing in them all others were conteyned, as they ſay. For by law of this virtual continencie, Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia and Thiatira were included in two of the other, viz. Sardis, &amp; Pergamus, which were their mother cities. What needed he haue named Thyatira, which by law of this virtuall continencie did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to direct his letter onely to head Churches? Againe, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is falſe: For he doth write principally to the ſeven, and to all other Churches in Aſia no further then hee writeth to all the Churches in the world. There were other Churches in Aſia, ſuch as were Coloſſe, Hierapolis, Troas, the Church at Miletum, and Aſſos, which the Centuries mention, which depended not on thoſe ſeven. If Coloſſe and Hierapolis were not, as Laodicaea, reedified when Iohn did write the Revelation, yet theſe other Churches were then extant. Not to name Magneſia and Tralles, the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancie whereof is fully cleared whatſoever Doct. Downam objecteth.</p>
            <p>To the third reaſon; from Chriſts manner of concluding his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, it is anſwered by denying the aſſumption. For Chriſt doth not uſe the plurall number in reſpect of that one Church preceding, but in reſpect of the ſeven collectiuely taken, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will that the members of each ſingular Church ſhould lay to heart both ſeverally and jointly, what ever was ſpoken to them and to others.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the Eccleſiaſticall examples, as of Rome, and Alexandria, two hundred yeares after Chriſt. And firſt to anſwer the reaſon brought for their increaſe, ſuch as could not keepe ſtill in a Pariſhionall meeting. The Propoſition is not of neceſſarie conſequence; for there were very extraordinarie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that which which was effected in the Church of Ieruſalem: From Chriſt himſelfe, from the reſidence of all the Apoſtles; from the ſtate of the people there aſſembled; from the ſtate of that Church; from the time in which theſe were done, Chriſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2189:16"/>
had prayed for them particularly, to which ſome attribute the firſt miraculous converſion by Peters preaching. Againe, it was fit, that being now aſcended into his glory, hee ſhould there more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly diſplay his power, and more conſpicuouſly ſwallow up the ſcandall of his croſſe. Againe, this Church had the labour of all the Apoſtles for a time in it: whoſe care and induſtrie we may gueſſe by their ordination of Deacons, that they might not bee diſtracted. Thirdly, the confluence and concourſe to Hieruſalem was of much people, who though explicitely they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt, yet had in them the faith of the Meſſiah, and therefore were neerer to the kingdome of God then the common Heathen. The ſtate of this Church was ſuch, that it was to ſend out light to all other, a common nurſerie to the world. Finally, the time being now, the beginning of planting that heavenly Kingdome, ſeeing beginnings of things are difficult, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the Lord did reveale his arme more extraordinarily. It doth not therefore follow from this particular, to the ſo great encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of theſe churches in tract of time. Nay, if theſe other Churches had enjoyed like increaſe in their beginnings, it would not follow, as thus. <hi>Thoſe Churches which within a few yeares had thus many in them, how numberſome were they many yeares after.</hi> Becauſe the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things hath a Period ſet, after which, even thoſe things which a great while encreaſed, doe decreaſe and goe downeward, as it was in Ieruſalem. Not to mention, that we deny the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But though the Argument is but Topicall, and can but breed an opinion onely, yet the teſtimonies ſeeme irrefragable. Tertullian teſtifying that halfe the Citizens in Rome was Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And Cornelius, that there was beſides himſelfe, and 45 Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, a numberſome Clergie.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That Tertullians ſpeech ſeemeth to be ſomewhat Hyperbolicall: for who can beleeue that more then halfe the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and world, after a ſort, were Chriſtians. But he ſpeaketh this, and truely in ſome regard, becauſe they were ſo potent through the world, that if they would haue made head they might haue troubled happily their perſecutors. Or elſe hee might ſay they were halfe of them Chriſtians, not becauſe there were ſo many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church: but becauſe there were ſo many who did beare ſome favour to their cauſe, and were it as ſafe as otherwiſe, would not ſtick to turne to them. But Tertullian knew no Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which did not meet, having prayers, exhortations, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering all kindes of Cenſures: If therefore there were more Churches in Rome in his time, it will make little for Dioceſan Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:2189:17"/>Touching Cornelius: we anſwer. It is not unlike but auditories were divided and tended by Preſbyteries. Cornelius keeping the Cathedrall Church, and being ſole Biſhop of them: but we deny that theſe made a Dioceſan Church. For firſt, the Cathedrall and Parochiall Churches were all within the Citie, in which regard hee is ſaid, <hi>Officium Epiſcopi impleviſſe in civitate Romae.</hi> Neither was his Church as ample as the Province, which that of Foeliciſſimus ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently teacheth. Secondly, we ſay that theſe Parochiall churches, were to the mother church, as chappels of caſe are to theſe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>in metrocomüs,</hi> they had communion with the mother church, going to the ſame for Sacraments and hearing the Word, and the Biſhop did goe out to them and preach amongſt them. For ſome of them were not ſuch as had liberty of Baptizing, and therefore could not be ſevered from communion with the head Church.</p>
            <p>Now to anſwer further, it is beyond 200 yeares for which our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is taken. For there is reaſon why people which had bene held together for 200 years as a Congregation, might now 50 years after be exceedingly encreaſed. The Eccleſiaſticall ſtorie noteth a moſt remarkeable increaſe of the faith, now in the time of Iulian before Cornelius. Neither muſt we thinke that an Emperour, as Philippus, favouring the faith, did not bring on multitudes to the like profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Secondly, we ſay, there is nothing in this of Cornelius which may not well ſtand, that the Church of Rome, though now much increaſed, did not keep together as one Church. For the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſaid to haue prayed and communicated with the repentant Biſhop, who had ordeyned Novatus: and we ſee how Cornelius doth amplifie Nouatus his pertinacie: From hence, that none of the numerous Clergie, nor yet of the people, very great and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, could turne him, or recall him, which argueth that the Church was not ſo aboundant, but that all the members of it had union and communion, for the mutuall edifying and reſtoring one of another. And I would faine know, whether the ſeven Deacons, ſeven Subdeacons, 42 Acolouthes, whether thoſe exorciſtes, Lectors, Porters about 52 are ſo many, as might not be taken up in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of fifteene or twentie thouſand? Surely the time might well require them, when many were to bee ſent forth to doe ſome part of miniſterie more privately. Not to name the errour of the Church in ſuperfluous multiplications of their Preſbyters, to vilifying of them, as they were ſuperfluous in the point of their Deacons. There were 60 in the church of Sophia for the help of the Liturgie. True it is, the Congregation could not but be exceeding great, and might well be called in a manner innumerable, though it were but of a twentie thouſand people. But becauſe of that which is reported touching diviſion by Euariſtus, Hyginus, Dioniſius, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2189:17"/>
Marcellinus, though there is no authenticke authour for it; neither is it likely in Hoſpinianus judgement. Let it be yeelded that there were ſome Parochiall diviſions, they were not many, and within the Citie, and were but as Chappels of eaſe to the cathedrall or mother Church.</p>
            <p>Concerning the objection from the Churches of Delgia, or the low Countries, we deny the propoſition: for we cannot reaſon thus. <hi>If many Maſters, and diſtinct formes of Schollers, in one free Schoole, be but one Schoole: then many Maſters and company of Schollers, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in many Schooles, are but one Schoole.</hi> Secondly, they haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the communitie of their Teachers, though not in the ſame individuall word tended by them. But it is one thing, when ſheep feed together in one common Paſture, though they bite not on the ſame individuall graſſe: Another thing when now they are tended in diverſe ſheepe gates. Not to urge, that in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Diſcipline, they may communicate as one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>Touching the objection from Geneua: I anſwer to the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by diſtinction. <hi>Thoſe who ſubject themſelues to a Preſbyteri<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, as not having power of governing themſelues within themſelues, as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it by ſubordination, theſe may in effect, as well be ſubject to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie: But thus the twenty foure Churches of Genevae doe not.</hi> They or haue power of governing themſelues, but for greater edification, voluntarily confederate, not to uſe nor exerciſe their power, but with mutuall communication, one asking the counſell and conſent of the other in that common Preſbyterie. Secondly, it is one thing for Churches to ſubject themſelues to a Biſhop and Conſiſtorie wherein they ſhall haue no power of ſuffrage: Another thing to communicate with ſuch a Preſbyterie, wherein themſelues are members and Iudges with others. Thirdly, ſay, they had no power, nor vvere no members in that Preſbyterie, yet it is one thing to ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the government of Ariſtocracie, another to the Biſhops Monarchicall government. For vvhile his Preſbyters are but as counſellours to a King, though he conſulteth vvith them, he alone governeth. Geneva made this conſociation, not as if the Prime Churches were imperfect, and to make one Church by this union: but becauſe though they were intire Churches, and had the power of Churches, yet they needed this ſupport in exerciſing of it, and that by this meanes the Miniſters and Seniors of it might haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. But what are all the 24 churches of Geneva to one of our Dioceſan Churches.</p>
            <p>Now to anſwer the reaſons. The firſt of them hath no part true: the propoſition is denyed. For theſe churches which had ſuch Preſbyters and Deacons as the Apoſtles inſtituted were
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2189:18"/>
Pariſhionall, that is, ſo conjoyned that they might and did meete in one Congregation. The Doctor did conſider the ſlenderneſſe of ſome of our Pariſhes, and the numberſome Clergie of ſome Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Church<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, but did not conſider there may be Preſbyteries much leſſer, and congregations ampler and fuller, and yet none ſo bigge as ſhould require that multitude he imagineth, nor made ſo little as might not haue Preſbyters and Deacons. What though ſuch Maior and Aldermen as are in London cannot bee had in every Town, yet ſuch a Towne as Cambridge may haue ſuch a Maior and Aldermen as Cambridge affoords, and the meaneſt market Town may haue, though not in degree, yet in kinde like Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. So is it in Preſbyters and other Officers: the multitude of Preſbyters falling forth <hi>per accidens,</hi> not that a Biſhop is ever to haue a like numberſome Preſbyterie, but becauſe the Church is ſo num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſome that actions liturgicall require more copious aſſiſtance, &amp; ſo wealthy, that it can well maintaine them. And beſide, becauſe of that Collegiate reaſon which was in them rather then Eccleſiaſtical, which the fathers had in their Preſbyteries; for the nurſing of plants, which might be tranſplanted for ſupply of vacant Churches, which was a point that the Apoſtles in planting Churches no what intended.</p>
            <p>To come to the aſſumption: <hi>But citie Churches onely had a Biſhop with Preſbyters and Deacons.</hi> Anſwer, Firſt, not to ſtand upon this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſet no Biſhops with Preſbyters, but Preſbyters onely, and they ſay Biſhops were given, when the Preſbyters had brought the Church to be more numberſome, the aſſumption is falſe, that <hi>Citie Churches onely had them.</hi> For the Scripture ſaith, they planted them Church by Church, that is, through every Church. Then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church had her Governours with in her ſelfe. we muſt uſe as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple interpretations as may be. Contrarily, the ſenſe which arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this to one from the reſt we cannot without evidence receiue it, <hi>in ambitioſis reſtricta interpretatio adhibenda eſt. Eccleſia</hi> doth not ſignifie any Church without difference, Pariſhionall, Dioceſan, or Provinciall; but onely a company orderly aſſembling, not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Such a company therefore as congregate decently to ſacred purpoſes is a Church by tranſlation. Beſides the indefinite is equivalent to the univerſall, as, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Now their interpretation beggeth every thing without any ground. For when Preſbyters may be taken but three wayes: <hi>diviſim, conjunctim,</hi> and <hi>diviſim and conjunction: diviſim</hi> one Preſbyter in one, another in another, <hi>conjunctim,</hi> diverſe Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in every Church, neither of theſe will ſerue their turne, the

latter onely being true: for Scripture making two kinds of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters without which the Church cannot bee governed, it is ſure it did giue of both kinds to every Church they planted. Now they ſeeing ſome Churches in our times to haue many, and ſome one, conſter it both waies <hi>Collectiue,</hi> many Preſbyters, and <hi>Singularly,</hi> one here and one there, and becauſe many Preſbyters cannot be thus placed in our frame of Churches, imagine the Church to containe Parochiall and Dioceſan Churches?</p>
            <p>But they will not ſeeme to ſpeake without reaſon; the Scripture ſay they placed Citie by Citie Preſbyters, and therefore in ſuch Churches as occupied Citie, Suburbes and Countrey, which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhionall ones doe not. But may not a Church of one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be in a citie, without occupying limits of citie, ſuburbes and countrey: and if Preſbyters be placed in ſuch a Church, may they not be ſaid to be placed in Cities. Indeed, if the Preſbyters placed in Cities were given to all the people within ſuch bounds, the caſe were other; but the citie is not literally thus to be underſtood, but metonymically for the Church in the Citie. Neither was the church in the citie, all within ſuch bounds; for the Saints of a place and Church of a place, are all one in the Apoſtles phraſe of ſpeech. As for that which is objected from Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, it is true, that in proceſſe of time, the Biſhop onely had a company of Preſbyters. Before, Churches kept in one Congregation and had all their Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. Churches ſhould ſo haue afterward bene divided, that all ſhould haue been alike for kind, though in circumſtantial excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſome were before other. What a groſſe thing is it to imagine, that the firſt frame the Apoſtles did erect was not for poſteritie to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate?

               <head>The firſt Argument.</head>
               <p>Thoſe whom the Holy Ghoſt inſtituted, they are of Chriſts or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining. But the Holy Ghoſt is ſayd to have placed Biſhops, Act, 20. Ergo, Biſhops are of Chriſts ordeining.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We deny the aſſumption: viz. That thoſe Presbytere of Epheſus were Dioceſan Biſhops. It is moſt plaine they were ſuch who did <hi>Communi conſilio</hi> tend the feeding and government of the Church; ſuch Biſhops whereof there might be more then one in one congregation. The common gloſſe referreth to this place that of <hi>Ierom</hi>: that at firſt Preſbyters did by common councell governe the Churches. Yea D. <hi>Downam</hi> doth count Epheſus as yet to haue had no Biſhop, who was ſent unto them after <hi>Pauls</hi> being at Rome, as he thinketh. And others defending the Hierarchie, who thinke him to have ſpoken to Biſhops, doe judge that theſe words belong not to Preſbyters, but are ſpoken in regard of others together then preſent with them, to wit, of <hi>Timothy, Soſipater, Tychicus,</hi> who, ſay they, were three Biſhops indeed; but that he ſpeaketh of theſe who indeed were in company, is quite beſides the text.</p>

               <head>The ſecond Argument.</head>
               <p>Such Paſtors as the ſeven Angels, Chriſt ordained. But ſuch were Dioceſan Biſhops. Ergo. The aſſumption proved. Thoſe who were of ſingular preheminencie amongſt other Paſtors, and had corrective power over all others in their Churches, they were Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Biſhops. But the Angels were ſingular perſons in every Church, having Eccleſiaſticall preheminencie and ſuperioritie of power. Ergo, they were Dioceſan Biſhops. The aſſumption is proved. Thoſe who were ſhadowed by ſeven ſingular Starres, were ſeven ſingular perſons. But the Angels were ſo. Ergo. Againe, Thoſe to whom onely Chriſt did write, who onely bare the praiſe, diſpraiſe, threatning, in regard of what was in the Church amiſſe, or otherwiſe: they had Majoritie of power above others. But theſe Angels are written to onely, they are onely praiſed, diſpraiſed, threatned. Ergo. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In the two firſt ſyllogiſmes the aſſumption is denyed. Secondly, in the firſt Proſyllogiſme the conſequence of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is denied, That they muſt needs be ſeven ſingular perſons. For ſeven ſingular ſtarres may ſignifie ſeven Vnites, whether ſingular or aggregative: ſeven pluralities of perſons who are ſo united as if they were one. And it is frequent in Scripture to note by a unity, a united multitude. Thirdly, the conſequence of the propoſition of the laſt proſyllogiſme is denyed. For though we ſhould ſuppoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular perſons written to, yet a preheminencie in order and greater authoritie, without majoritie of power, is reaſon enough why they ſhould be written to ſingularly, and blamed, or praiſed above other. Thus the maſter of a Colledge, though he have no negative voyce, might be written to, &amp; blamed for the miſdemeanors of his colledg, not that hee hath a power overruling all: but becauſe ſuch is his dignitie, that did he doe his endevour in dealing with, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding others, there is no diſorder which he might not ſee redreſſed. Fourthly, againe the aſſumption may bee denyed: That they are onely written to. For though they are onely named, yet the whole Churches are written to in them; the ſupereminent member of the Church by a Synecdoche put for the whole Church. For it was the cuſtome in the Apoſtles times, and long after, that not any ſingular perſons, but the whole Churches were written unto, as in <hi>Pauls</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles is manifeſt, and in many examples Eccleſiaſticall. And that this was done by Chriſt here, the Epiphonemaes teſtifie. <hi>Let every one heare what the ſpirit ſpeaketh to the Churches.</hi>

               <head>The third Argument.</head>
               <p>Thoſe whom the Apoſtles ordained, were of Apoſtolicall inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But they ordained Biſhops. Ergo. The aſſumption is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by induction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:2189:20"/>Firſt, they ordained <hi>Iames</hi> Biſhop of Ieruſalem preſently after Chriſts aſcention. Ergo they ordained Biſhops. This is teſtified by <hi>Euſebius, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Hiſto. cap.</hi> 1. out of <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Hegeſippus</hi>: yea that the Church he ſate in was reſerved to his time, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. &amp; 32.

For though hee could not receive power of order, yet they might give him power of juriſdiction, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne him his Church. So that though he were an Apoſtle, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſingular aſſignation, and ſtaying here till death, he might iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called the Biſhop, as indeed he was. If he were not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, whom had they for their Paſtor.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thoſe ordinary Paſtors who were called Apoſtles of Churches in compariſon of other Biſhops and Preſbyters; they were in order and maioritie of power before other. But <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus</hi> was the Apoſtle of the Philippians, though they had other called Biſhops. Chap. 1.14. Ergo. The aſſumption; that he is ſo called, as their eminent Paſtor, is manifeſt by authorities. <hi>Ierom. in Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>Theod.</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> on the ſame place. Neither is it like this ſacred appropriate name ſhould bee given to any in regard of meere ſending hither or thither. Yea this, <hi>that he was ſent,</hi> did argue him there Biſhop: for when the Churches had to ſend any where they did uſually intreat their Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Archippus</hi> they inſtituted at Coloſſe. Ergo.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were inſtituted Biſhops, the one of Epheſus, the other of Crete. Ergo. The Antecedent is proved thus. That which is preſuppoſed in their Epiſtles, is true. But it is preſuppoſed that they were Biſhops in theſe Churches. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. The aſſumption proved. Thoſe whom the Epiſtles preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to have had Epiſcopall authoritie given them to bee exerciſed in thoſe Churches, they are preſuppoſed to have been ordained Biſhops there. But the Epiſtles preſuppoſe them to have had E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall authoritie given them to bee exerciſed in thoſe Churches. Ergo. The aſſumption proved. 1. If the Epiſtles written to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> be the paternes of the Epiſcopall function, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them, and in them all Biſhops, then they were Biſhops. But they are ſo. Ergo. 2 Againe, whoſoever preſcribing to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> their duties as governours in theſe Churches, doth preſcribe the very dutie of Biſhops, he doth preſuppoſe them Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. But <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo: For what is the office of a Biſhop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide teaching, but to ordaine and governe: and governe with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie of preheminence, and maioritie of power in compariſon of other. Now theſe are the things which they have in charge, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5.

1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3.11. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.16. Ergo. 3 Thoſe things which were written to informe not onely <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> but in them all their ſucceſſours who were Dioceſan Biſhops, thoſe were written to Dioceſan Biſhops. But theſe were ſo. Ergo, to Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Biſhops. Now that Dioceſan Biſhops were their ſucceſſours, is proved. 1. Either they, or Presbyters, or Congregations. Not the latter. 2. Againe, Thoſe who did ſucceed them were their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours. But Dioceſan Biſhops did. Ergo. The aſſumption is manifeſt by authorities. In Epheſus from <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>Stephanus</hi> in the Councell of Chalcedon. And in Crete, though no one is read to have ſucceeded, yet there were Biſhops Dioceſan. And we read of <hi>Philip</hi> Biſhop of Gortina the Metropolis. 4. Thoſe who were ordinarily reſident, and lived and died at theſe Churches, were were there Biſhops. But <hi>Timothy</hi> was bid abide here, <hi>Titus</hi> to ſtay to correct all things, and they lived and died here. For <hi>Timothy</hi> it is teſtified by <hi>Hegiſippus,</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> out of them, whom who ſo refuſe to beleeve, deſerve themſelues no beliefe. Ergo, they were there Biſhops. Againe, Ierom. in Cat. Iſidorus de vita &amp; morte Sanct. Antoninus par. 1. Tit. 6. cap. 28. Niceph. lib. 10. Cap. 11. theſe doe depoſe, that they lived and died there. Further, to prove them Biſhops. 5. Their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was Evangeliſticall and extraordinarie, or ordinarie; not the firſt; that was to end. For their function as aſſigned to theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and conſiſting eſpecially in ordaining and iuriſdiction, was not to end. Ergo. Aſſumption proved. That function which was neceſſarie to the beeing of the Church, was not to end. But the function they had as being aſſigned to certaine Churches, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to the beeing of the Church, Ergo. &amp;c. 6 Finally, that which Antiquitie teſtifieth, agreeing with Scripture, is true. But they teſtifie that they were Biſhops, which the ſubſcriptions of the Epiſtles alſo affirme. Ergo. Euſebius Lib. 5. Cap. 4. Dyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſ. Arcepag. Doroth. in Synopſi.

                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>We deny the aſſumption of the firſt Syllogiſme, with all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances brought to proue it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for <hi>Iames,</hi> we deny he was ordained Biſhop, or that it can be proued from antiquitie, that he was more then other Apoſtles. That which <hi>Euſebius</hi> reporteth, is grounded on <hi>Clement,</hi> whom we know to be a forged magnifier of Romiſh orders, and in this ſtory he doth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2189:21"/>
ſeeme to imply, that Chriſt ſhould haue ordeyned <hi>Peter, Iohn</hi> and <hi>James</hi> the greater, Biſhops. Seeing he maketh theſe to haue ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Iames</hi> after they had got of Chriſt the ſupreme degree of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which theſe forged deceitfull Epiſtles of Anacletus do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme. Secondly, as the ground is ſuſpected; ſo the phraſe of the Fathers, <hi>Calling him the Biſhop of that Church,</hi> doth not imply that he was a Biſhop properly ſo called. The fathers uſe the words of <hi>Apostoli</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopi</hi> amply, not in their ſtrict &amp; formall propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie. <hi>Ierom</hi> on the firſt to the Galathians, and in his Epiſtle to <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> affirmeth that the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the Biſhop might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Apoſtles. So many fathers call <hi>Phillip</hi> an Apoſtle. <hi>Clem.</hi> 5. <hi>Conſt. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap. ult. Tertul. de Bapt. cap.</hi> 8. and others. In like manner they call the Apoſtles Biſhops; not in proprietie of ſpeech, but becauſe they did ſuch things as Biſhops doe, and in remaining here or there made reſemblance of them. Thus <hi>Peter, Paul, Iohn, Barnabas,</hi> and all the reſt, are by the Ancients called Biſhops. Obj. This is granted true, touching others, but not in this inſtance of <hi>Iames</hi>: becauſe it is ſo likely and agreeable to Scripture, as well as all other Story; that when all the reſt of the Apoſtles departed out of Ieruſalem, he did ſtill abide with them even to death. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, though this bee but very conjecturall, yet it nothing bettereth the cauſe here. It followeth not, Hee did abide with this Church. Ergo, he was the proper Biſhop of this Church. For not abiding in one Church doth make a Biſhop: but he muſt ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in it, that he muſt from the power of his office, onely be bound to teach that Church: ſecondly, to teach it as an ordinary Paſtor of it: thirdly, to governe it with a power of juriſdiction, limited one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that Church. But <hi>Iames</hi> was bound to the reſt of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion by his office, as they ſhould from all the world reſort thither. Secondly, he did not teach but as an Embaſſadour extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent from Chriſt, and infallibly led by his Spirit into all truth. Ergo, not as an ordinary Biſhop. Thirdly, as the reſt in what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces ſoever they reſted, had not their juriſdiction diminiſhed, but had power occaſionally, as well where they were not, as where they were; ſo it was with <hi>Iames.</hi> This might happily make the phraſe to be more founded out of <hi>Iames,</hi> that he did in this circumſtance of reſiding, more neerly expreſſe an ordinary Paſtor then any other. It is plaine, Antiquitie did hold them all Biſhops, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them ſo to be, <hi>a Priori &amp; Poſteriori:</hi> the Author <hi>de quaeſt. vet. &amp; nov. teſt. cap.</hi> 97. <hi>Nemo ignorat Epiſcopos ſalvatorem Eccleſijs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

regularly doe, <hi>Oecum. cap.</hi> 22. <hi>in Act.</hi> It is to be noted, ſayth he, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had the dignitie of Biſhops: for they did not make Biſhops onely, but Preſbyters alſo. Now wee muſt conſter the ancient, as taking them onely eminentlie and virtuallie to have been biſhops, or elſ we muſt judge them to have been of this mind, That the Apoſtles had both as extraordinary legats moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple power of teaching and governing ſuting thereto, as alſo the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary office of Biſhops and Paſtors with power of teaching and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, ſuch as doe eſſentially and miniſterially agree to them: which indeed D. Downam himſelfe confuteth, as Popiſh, and not without reaſon, though while he doth ſtrive to have <hi>Iames</hi> both an Apoſtle and a Biſhop properly, himſelfe doth confirme it not a little.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it will not be unprofitable to ſhew ſome reaſons why the Apoſtles neither were nor might be in both theſe callings.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That which might make us doubt of all their teaching and writing, is to be hiſſed forth as a moſt dangerous aſſertion. But to make <hi>Iames,</hi> &amp; ſo any of them, haue both theſe offices in proprietie, might make us doubt. Ergo. The aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proved thus. That which doth ſet them in office of teaching liable to errour, when they teach from one office, as well as infallibly directed with a rule of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcerning, when they teach from the other, that doth make us ſubject to doubting in all they teach and write. But this opinion doth ſo. Ergo. The propoſition is, for ought I ſee, of neceſſarie truth, the aſſumption no leſſe true. For if there bee any rule to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <hi>Iames</hi> infalliblie, as he was formally the ordinarie biſhop of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, let us heare it: if there were none, may not I queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all his teaching and writing were not ſubject to errour. For if he taught them as an ordinary biſhop, and did write his Epiſtle ſo, then certainly it might erre. If he did not teach them ſo, then did he not that he was ordained to, neither was he properly an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Paſtor, but taught as an extraordinary Embaſſadour from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thoſe offices which cannot bee exerciſed by one, but the one muſt expell the other, were never by God conjoyned in one perſon. But theſe doe ſo: Ergo. The aſſumption is manifeſt. Becauſe it is plain, non can be called to teach as a legat extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, with infallible aſſiſtance, and unlimited juriſdiction, but he is made uncapable of being bound to one Church, teaching as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie perſon with juriſdiction limited to that one Church. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, one can no ſooner be called to doe this, but at leaſt the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the other is ſuſpended. Thirdly, that which is to no end, is not to be thought to be ordained of God. But to give one an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie authoritie whereby to doe this or that in a Church, who
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2189:22"/>
had a higher and more excellent power of office, whereby to doe thoſe ſame things in the ſame Church, is to no end. Ergo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it will be denied that any other power of order, or to teach and adminiſter ſacraments was given, then that hee had as an Apoſtle: but onely juriſdiction or right to this Church as his Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To this I reply, firſt, that if hee had no new power of order, he could not be an ordinarie Biſhop properlie and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally ſo called. Secondly, I ſay power of governing ordinarie was not needfull for him who had power as an Apoſtle in any Church where hee ſhould come. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But it was not in vaine, that by aſſignation hee ſhould have right to reſide in this Church as his Church. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If by the mutuall agreement in which they were guided by the ſpirit, it was thought meet, that <hi>Iames</hi> ſhould abide in Ieruſalem, there tending both the Church of the Iewes, and the whole circumciſion, as they by occaſion reſorted thither, then by vertue of his Apoſtleſhip hee had no leſſe right to tend thoſe of the circumciſion by reſiding here, then the other had right to doe the ſame in the Provinces through which they walked. But they did think it meet that he ſhould there tend that Church, and with that Church all the Circumciſion, as they occaſionally reſorted thereto. Ergo. For though hee was aſſigned to reſide there, yet his Apoſtolicke Paſtorall care was as <hi>Iohns</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> towards the whole multitude of the diſperſed Iewes, Galath. 2. Now if it were aſſigned to him for his abode, as hee was an Apoſtolicke Paſtor, what did hee need aſſignation under any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther title. Nay he could not have it otherwiſe aſſigned, unleſſe wee make him to ſuſtaine another perſon, viz. of an ordinary Paſtor, which he could not be who did receive no ſuch power of order as ordinarie Paſtors have.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That calling which hee could not exerciſe without beeing much abaſed, that hee never was ordained unto, as a poynt of honour for him. But hee could not exerciſe the calling of an ordinarie Biſhop, but hee muſt bee abaſed. Hee muſt bee bound by office to meddle with authoritie and juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in one Church, hee muſt teach as an ordinarie man lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to errour. Ergo, hee was neuer ordained to bee a Biſhop properlie. If it bee ſacriledgee to reduce a Biſhop to the degree of a Preſbyter, what is it to bring an Apoſtle to the degree of a Biſhop? True it is, hee might have been aſſigned to reſide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in that Church without travelling, and bee no whit aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but then he muſt keepe there as Paſtor of it with Apoſtolicall authoritie, caring not for that Church, but the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Iewes, which he might doe without travelling. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2189:22"/>
who ſo keeped in that Church, hee did not need to goe forth as the reſt; for the Iewes from all parts come to him. But he could not make his abide in it as an ordinarie teacher and governour, without becomming many degrees lower then hee was. For to live without going forth, in the mother Church of all the world, as an ordinary paſtor, was much leſſe honour then ro tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile as <hi>Peter</hi> one while into Aſſyria, another while through Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Galatia, Bithynia, as an Apoſtle. Even as to ſit at home in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull privat place is leſſe honourable then to goe abroad as Lord Embaſſadour hither or thither. Honour and eaſe are ſeldome bed-fellowes. Neither was <hi>Iames</hi> his honour in this circumſtance of the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eſt, but in having ſuch an honorable place wherein to exerciſe his Apoſtolicke calling. As for that queſtion, who was their ordinarie Paſtor, it is eaſily anſwered; Their Preſbyters, ſuch as <hi>Linus</hi> or <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in Rome, ſuch as Epheſus and other Churches had. <hi>Iames</hi> was their Paſtor alſo, but with extraordinary authoritie. What needed they an ordinarie Biſhop, which grew needfull (as the favourers of the Hierarchie ſay) to ſupply the abſence of Apoſtles, when now they were to deceaſe? What needed then here an ordinary Biſhop, where the Apoſtles were joyntly to keepe twelve yeares together, and one to reſide during his life, according to the current of the ſtory. Thus much about the firſt inſtance.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond inſtance of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and the argument dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen from it. Firſt, we deny the propoſition. For had ſome ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Paſtors been ſo ſtiled, it might imply but a preheminencie of dignitie in them above other: wherefore unleſſe this bee interſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is unſound, viz. <hi>Thoſe ordinarie Paſtors, who are called Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in compariſon of others, becauſe the Apoſtles did give to them po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of ordination, juriſdiction, and peereleſſe preheminencie, which they did not give to others, they are above others.</hi> Secondly, the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is falſe altogether: Firſt, that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was an ordinarie Paſtor: ſecondly, that hee was called an Apoſtle in compariſon of inferiour Paſtors of that Church. <hi>Obj.</hi> But the iudgment of <hi>Ierom, Theodoret, Chryſoſtom,</hi> is that he was. <hi>Anſw.</hi> the common judgement is, that he was an egregious teacher of theirs, but further then this, many of the teſtimonies doe not depoſe. Now ſo he might be: for he was an Evangeliſt, and one who had viſited and laboured among them, and therefore might be called their teacher, yea an egregious teacher, or Doctor of them. Nay, S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth plainly inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, that hee was an Evangeliſt: for he ſayth hee was made their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle by the Apoſtle, while he ſent him to exhort them, and becauſe he was a good man, he was deſired of the people. Where he maketh him ſent, not for perpetuall reſidence amongſt them, but for the <hi>tranſient</hi> exhorting of them, and maketh him ſo deſired of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2189:23"/>
Philippians, becauſe hee was a good man, not becauſe he was their ordinarie Paſtor. <hi>Ieroms</hi> teſtimonie on this place doth not evince. For the name of Apoſtles and Doctors is largely taken, and as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to one, who as an Evangeliſt did inſtruct them, as to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Theod.</hi> doth plainly take him to have been as their ordinarie biſhop, but no otherwiſe then <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts are ſayd to have been biſhops: which how true it is, in the next argument ſhall bee diſcuſſed. For even <hi>Theodoret</hi> doth take him to have been ſuch an Apoſtolick perſon as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were. Now theſe were as truely called biſhops as the Apoſtles themſelves. Neither is the rule of <hi>Theodoret</hi> to be admitted: for it is unlike that the name of Apoſtle ſhould be communicated then with ordinarie Paſtors, where now there was danger of confounding thoſe eminent miniſters of Chriſt with others, and when now the Apoſtles were deceaſed, that then it ſhould ceaſe to be aſcribed to them. Againe, how ſhall we know that a biſhop is to be placed in a citie, that hee muſt be a perſon thus and thus (according to <hi>Pauls</hi> Canons) quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: all is voided and made not to belong to a biſhop. For thoſe who are called bishops, were Preſbyters and no biſhops, biſhops being then to be underſtood onely under the name of Apoſtles &amp; Angels. Thirdly, antiquitie doth teſtifie, that this was an honour to biſhops, when this name was Eccleſiaſtically appropriated to them. But if they ever had been termed by the name of Apoſtles before, this had been a debaſing of them. Neither is there reaſon why they ſhould be called Apoſtles. In juriſdiction Apoſtolical the Apoſtles were not ſucceeded. Iuriſdiction Epiſcopal they never exerciſed, nor had, and therefore could not be ſucceeded in it. The Apoſtles gave to Preſbyters that which Chriſt gave them out of his power, even the power of ordinary government. They are bid <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to feed, as well by government as doctrine They are bid not to play the Lords over the flock. What feare of tyrannie where there is no power of government? But lay authorities aſide, conſider the thing from the text it ſelfe. Firſt, <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemeth but occaſionallie to ſend him, he having purpoſed to have ſent <hi>Timothy,</hi> who as yet could not bee employed. <hi>I thought it neceſſarie to ſend Epaphroditus to you.</hi> Secondly, hee doth implie, that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> had not returned to them, but that he ſent him; and that therefore he was not the ordinary Biſhop of it. It is like, hee was but ſent till <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> might be diſpatched to them. Neither is it any thing probable he ſhould be called an Apoſtle, as their ordinarie and eminent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor. In the Scriptures, none are ſaid to be Apoſtles further then they are in habitude to ſome ſending them. Now this is undoubted, the Philippians had ſent him to <hi>Paul.</hi> It is then moſt probabl when he is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2189:23"/>
called their Apoſtle, it is in regard he was ſent by them, which the Apoſtle pointeth at in the next words, <hi>who hath ministred to me the things needfull which you ſent by him.</hi> Object. But it is unlikely that this word appropriated to the Twelue, ſhould be uſed of thoſe ſent civily. Not ſo, for while the perſons ſending are ſignified, they are ſufficiently contradiſtinguiſhed; it being the Priviledge of the Apoſtles, that they were the Apoſtles of Chriſt Ieſus, not ſimply that they were Apoſtles. Secondly, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. It is made common to all that are ſent. For though Chriſt meane it of himſelfe, yet he implies it by a diſcourſe, <hi>a genere ad ſpeciem.</hi> Thirdly, we ſee the like phraſe, 2. Cor. 8. <hi>the Apoſtles of the Churches.</hi> For <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> there underſtandeth thoſe whom the Churches had ſent for that preſent. That doth not hinder, they were ſent by <hi>Paul</hi> to the Churches, therefore the Churches might not ſend them with their contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Neither is this an argument that he was their Biſhop, becauſe their Church ſent him: for they ſent Apoſtles themſelues and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts alſo more ordinarily, it being their office to goe from Church to Church, for the edification of them.</p>
                  <p>For the inſtance of <hi>Archippus</hi> I finde it not urged.</p>
                  <p>Now to come to the laſt inſtances of <hi>Timotheus</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, we deny the Antecedent, that they were inſtituted Biſhops by <hi>Paul.</hi> And in the firſt proſillogiſme we deny the Aſſumption: <hi>that the Epiſtles doe preſuppoſe ſo much.</hi> And to the proſillogiſm, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to proue this aſſertion denyed, we anſwer: firſt, to the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, by diſtinguiſhing the Epiſcopall authoritie, which is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered both in regard of that which is materiall, and in regard of the formall reaſon which doth agree to it. The Propſition is true, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it of authority in both theſe regards; thoſe who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed to haue had authority Epiſcopall given them, both for the ſubſtance of it, and the formall reaſon which doth agree to it in an ordinary Biſhop, they are preſuppoſed Biſhops: but this is denyed. For they are preſuppoſed to haue and exerciſe power Epiſcopall for the materiall of it, as Apoſtles had alſo; but not to haue and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in that manner and formallitie which doth agree to a Biſhop, but which doth agree to an Euangeliſt, and therefore they are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to doe the worke of an Euangeliſt, to exerciſe all that power they did exerciſe as Euangeliſts. There is nothing that <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to <hi>Timothy</hi> to doe in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or to <hi>Titus Crete,</hi> which himſelfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in perſon might not and would not haue done. If we ſhould reaſon then thus: He who did exerciſe Epiſcopall power in theſe churches, he is preſuppoſed to haue been Biſhop in them. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is not true, but with limitation: He who exerciſed Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall power after that formall manner, which doth agree to the office of a Biſhop, he was Biſhop; but not he who exerciſeth the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2189:24"/>
power <hi>ſecundum aliam rationem &amp; modum;</hi> viz. after ſuch a manner as doth agree to an Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond maine proofe, wee denie the propoſition. If patternes for Biſhops, then written to Biſhops. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, Apoſtles, Euangeliſts, ordinarie Paſtors, haue many things common in their adminiſtration. Hence is it, that the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the one may be a patterne to another, though they are not identically and formally of one calling. Councels haue enjoyned all Preſbyters to be well ſeene in theſe Epiſtles, as being patternes for them, <hi>Vide Aug. De doctrin. Christ. cap.</hi> 16. <hi>lib.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>To the third reaſon. <hi>Who ſo preſcribing them their duties doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the verie duties of Biſhops, hee doeth take them to haue beene Biſhops.</hi> The Propoſition is not true without a double limitation. If the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhould propoſe ſuch duties of Biſhops as they in later times uſurped, he doth not therfore preſuppoſe them Biſhops, becauſe theſe are duties of Euangeliſts, agreeing to Biſhops onely by uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. Againe, ſhould he propoſe thoſe duties which, ſay they, the word doth aſcribe and appropriate to Biſhops, yet if he doe not preſcribe them as well in regard of matter as forme exerciſed by them, it will not follow that he doth take them for Biſhops: nor that <hi>Paul</hi> doth propoſe the verie duties of Biſhops, both in ſubſtance and manner of performance. Secondly, wee deny him to propoſe for ſubſtance the duties of Biſhops. For hee doth not bid him or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, as having a further ſacramentall power then other Miniſters, nor governe with power directiue and correctiue over others. This exceedeth the bounds of all miniſteriall power. Thirdly, <hi>Timothie</hi> is not bid to lay on hands or doe any other act, when now churches were conſtituted, but with concurrence of thoſe churches; <hi>ſalvo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſcujuſque Eccleſiae jure,</hi> the Apoſtles did not otherwiſe. For though <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to him alone, that was becauſe he was occupied not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Churches perfectly framed, but alſo in the erecting &amp; framing of others. Secondly, becauſe they were in degree and dignity aboue all other ordinary governours of the Church, which their Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like preheminence was ſufficient, why they ſhould be written to alone.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth reaſon: <hi>Thoſe things which were written to informe, not onely Timothy and Titus, but all their ſucceſſours, who were Dioceſan Biſhops, thoſe were written to Dioceſan Biſhops. But theſe were ſo. Ergo,</hi> The Propoſition is not true, becauſe it preſuppoſeth that nothing written to any perſons, can informe Dioceſan Biſhops, unleſſe the perſons to whom it is written be formally in that ſelfe ſame order. For if one Apoſtle ſhould write to another touching the duty Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique, it might informe any Doctor or Paſtor whatſoever. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we deny Dioceſan Biſhops are (<hi>de jure</hi>) ſucceſſours. As for the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2189:24"/>
equivocal Catalogue which maketh all who are read Biſhops to haue been Dioceſan, we ſhall ſpeake of them hereafter. The Biſhops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> in the time of the <hi>Chalcedom</hi> Councell, were not all of one cut: and there are no churches read in <hi>Crete</hi> which were not Congregations. There is no more to proue <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> a Metropolitan, then to proue <hi>Ignatius</hi> Metropolitan of Syria. For what doth ſtorie relate, but that <hi>Phillip</hi> was amongſt other a Biſhop of thoſe Churches which were in Crete. There are many Churches in England, a Miniſter of which Churches is ſuch an one, that is one Miniſter amongſt others of thoſe Churches. To that of their reſiding there and dying in theſe Churches. Firſt, the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not neceſſarie. For as <hi>Iames</hi> might reſide exerciſing an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall inſpection in a particular Church, ſo might theſe exerciſe an Euangeliſticall function how long ſoever they reſided. Secondly, the aſſumption will not be found true for ordinarie conſtant reſidence neither in Scripture nor fathers. For <hi>Timothie,</hi> though he be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſtay at Epheſus, yet this doth not argue it, that he was enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ordinary reſidence. For firſt it was a ſigne he was not Biſhop, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> did exhort him, for he would well haue known, he might not being their ordinary Paſtor leaue them, further then the more important good of the Church ſhould occaſion. 2. He is bid to ſtay there, not finally, but till the Apoſtle ſhould come to him, which though he might be delayed, it is plain he then intended. So <hi>Titus</hi> is placed in <hi>Crete,</hi> not to ſtay there, and ſet downe his reſt, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, further to ſet, as it were, and exedifie the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke, which <hi>Paul</hi> had begunne. God gaue Ceremonies <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is not euer a correcting of any thing amiſſe, but a ſetling every thing right, by erecting the ſubſtance foreſhadowed. But ſay it were correcting, it were but ſuch a correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as one might performe <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> with a little longer ſtay, though not ordinary reſidence. By Scripture the contrary is manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, it is not like that <hi>Timothy</hi> was placed Biſhop after <hi>Pauls</hi> being at Rome; for when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he prayed him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now he was going to Macedonia, to ſtay at Epheſus, he doth intimate that when hee left him they were there both together. Secondly, when he wiſhed him to abide there, he had a meaning to come unto <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> thither where he left him, ſo as at leaſt to call on him, and ſee the Church. But <hi>Paul</hi> after his parting from the Preſbyters knew he ſhould never ſee the Epheſians more. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. If wee ſay he doth foretell it for likely, ſo wee may ſay, that of wolues ariſing was, and call all into queſtion. Neither is it likely, but that teares would haue broke his heart, and made him yeeld in the peremptories of his ſpeech, had not his ſoule been divinely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded. Thirdly, he had no meaning when he left them to conſtitute
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2189:25"/>
                     <hi>Timothy</hi> to be their Biſhop: for he would not haue omitted ſuch an argument of conſolation to hearts ſo heavie. Nor he doth not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any ſuch purpoſe when he did write to them his Epiſtle. He telleth Churches uſually when himſelfe hath meaning to ſee them, or to ſend others. Fourthly, Timothie was with Paul while he was in bonds at Rome as witnes thoſe inſcriptions of the Epiſtles to the <hi>Colloſſians</hi> and <hi>Philippians</hi>; yea <hi>Timothy</hi> was ſo with him, as to bee imployed by him, ſent forth, and returne to him, which is manifeſt. <hi>Phillip.</hi> 2. If he were after this placed in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> yet he was not pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be reſident, for in the end of the Epiſtle, he doth bid <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> come to him, and bring <hi>Marke,</hi> that they might miniſter to him. Againe when he did write the 2 Epiſtle, <hi>Timothie</hi> was not <hi>Epheſus,</hi> for he doth bid him ſalute <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Pricilla</hi> and <hi>Oneſiphorus.</hi> Obj. But is like theſe were at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> for their <hi>Paul</hi> left <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcilla.</hi> They came occaſionally, they did not fixe there, which <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> alſo judgeth. And the houſe of <hi>Oneſiphorus, Bernard</hi> taketh it, was at Iconium in Lycaonia, ſo that it is like he was in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue countrey at this time, even Iconium, Liſtra, Derbe, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily is the cauſe why the Scholaſticall ſtorie doth make him Biſhop of Lyſtra, becauſe hither he was laſt ſent. He was ſo here, as that the Apoſtle did but ſend him to ſee them, for hee biddeth him come before winter. Beſides, there are many probabilities hee was not at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> for he ſpeaketh of it through the Epiſtle, as a place now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from him. <hi>Thou knoweſt what Oneſiphorus did for me at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> not <hi>where now thou are. I haue ſent Tychius to Epheſus,</hi> not <hi>to thee,</hi> to ſupply thy place while thou ſhalt bee abſent. Finally, after <hi>Paules</hi> death he did not returne to Epheſus, but by common conſent went to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle, and very little before his death came to Epheſus, if ever. As for the Fathers therfore in this point, if they teſtifie ordinarie reſidence, which they doe not, wee haue libertie to renounce them; but they teſtifie onely that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in that Church, becauſe his ſtay was longer there then Euangeliſts did uſe to make, and he is thought to haue ſuffered mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome there. So for <hi>Titus,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> ſent him to Crete to doe that worke is uncertaine; but this is certaine, it was before his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Corinths the ſecond time, and going to Rome. This likewiſe, that <hi>Paul</hi> was then in travelling, &amp; as it is like being in the parts of Macedonia did meane to winter at <hi>Nicopolis.</hi> When he did write the Epiſtle he doth ſhew it was not his meaning that <hi>Titus</hi> ſhould ſtay there, for he doth bid him to meet him at Nicopolis, where he meant to be as it is likely, but <hi>Titus</hi> comming did not meet him there but at length found him in Macedonia, whence <hi>Paul</hi> did ſend him to the Corinthians, <hi>thanking God for his promptneſſe even of his own accord to be imployed amongſt them,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.16. which doth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2189:25"/>
ſhew he had not been made an ordinarie Biſhop any where. We find that he did accompany <hi>Paul</hi> at Rome, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. and when <hi>Paul</hi> writ his ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> he was in Dalmatia. Whence <hi>Aquinas</hi> doth thinke him to haue been Biſhop of that place. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we thinke him that will be carried from ſuch preſumptions, (yea manifeſt arguments) by <hi>Hegeſippus, Clemens,</hi> and hiſtorie groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on them, to be too much affected to ſo weak authors, and wiſh not credit with him, who counts him unworthy credit, that will not ſweare what ſuch men depoſe.</p>
                  <p>Touching the proofe that followeth. <hi>That either their function was Euangeliſticall and extraordinarie, or ordinarie. But their function as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to thoſe Churches was not extraordinary.</hi> We deny this aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the proofe of it. <hi>That the function that theſe exerciſed as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to certain Churches (theſe two by name) was neceſſary to the being of the Church.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe they were aſſigned to doe thoſe things which are to be done for ever in the church after a more tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent manner; viz. as Euangeliſts; and aſſignation of them to doe thoſe things in certaine Churches after this manner, was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to perpetuate the being of the Church. Aſſignation to chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to doe the work of ordinarie Paſtors is indeed neceſſarie: not aſſignation to doe the worke of Euangeliſts.</p>
                  <p>To that finall reaſon, what antiquity doth teſtifie agreeing with Scriptures is true, and ſo to be taken. What they ſpeak ſo agreeing, that it is virtually conteyned in them, and may rightly be deduced from them, is to be beleeved and received by a divine faith. But what they ſpeake not plainly contradicted, but yet no way included, may be admitted <hi>fide humana,</hi> if the firſt relators be well qualified witneſſes. But what they ſpeake from ſuch as <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Hegeſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> it is in effect of light credulity. A corrupt conſcience bent to decline is glad of every colour which it may pretend to juſtifie it ſelfe in declyning.</p>
                  <p>To the aſſumption we anſwer. What doe not ſome ancient enough call <hi>Timothy? Ambroſe</hi> ſaith he was a <hi>Deacon</hi> one while, a <hi>Preſbyter</hi> another while, and in like ſenſe a <hi>Primate</hi> and a <hi>Biſhop. Lyra</hi> proveth him from many authorities to haue been an Arch-biſhop, and <hi>Titus</hi> a Prieſt. <hi>Beda</hi> calleth him an <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> But to gather on theſe, that he was in proprietie of ſpeech all theſe, were abſurd. Obj. I, but they call him Biſhop on other grounds, becauſe aſſigned to this Church. Anſ. They call him Biſhop becauſe he was aſſigned to this Church, not onely to teach, but alſo to ordeyne <hi>Deacons Preſbyters.</hi> For whereſoever they found this done, and by whomſoever, they did call them Biſhops, as I noted before from <hi>Oecumen.</hi> The fathers therfore may be well conſtrued calling theſe Biſhops, becauſe they made lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtay in theſe Churches then Euangeliſts did uſually; &amp; did preach
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2189:26"/>
and ordaine, and doe in theſe Churches all ſuch things which Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in their time uſed to doe. But that he was not an Euangeliſt, and more then an ordinary Biſhop they doe not deny. <hi>Salmeron</hi> himſelfe in his firſt Diſputation on 1. <hi>Tim. pag.</hi> 405. <hi>Videtur ergo quod fuerit pluſqnam Epiſcopus, etiamſi ad tempus in ea civitate ut Paſtor prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaverit &amp; ſacros ordines promoverit, unde quidem vocant eum Epiſcopum.</hi> Finally, ſhould they in rigour and formall propriety make him an ordinarie Paſtor, from the firſt time <hi>Paul</hi> did write to him, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily reſident to his end; they ſhould teſtifie a thing, as I hope I haue ſhewed, contrary to Scripture, yea contrarie to that text which maketh him to haue done the worke of an Euangeliſt. As for the ſhew from the Subſcriptions we haue ſpoken ſufficiently.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſhew that they were not properly Biſhops. Firſt, we haue ſhewed that they were but ſubrogated to do thoſe ſuppoſed Epiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall duties a while, but were not there fixed, to make their ordinary abode. Therfore not Biſhops properly. Secondly, they who did the work of an Euangeliſt in all that they did, did not perform formally the worke of a Biſhop. But theſe did ſo. As is vouched of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Doe the worke of an Euangeliſt.</hi> Ergo. The Propoſition is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. If an Euangeliſt &amp; Biſhop cannot be formally of one office, then the act of an Euangeliſt, and the act of an ordinarie Paſtor or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop cannot be formally one. For when everie thing doth <hi>agere ſecundum quod actu eſt,</hi> thoſe things which are not the ſame formally, their worke and effect cannot be formally the ſame. But the Euangeliſt and the ordinarie Paſtor or Biſhops, are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally the ſame. Ergo. The aſſumption the Apoſtle proveth, by that diſtinct enumeration of thoſe whom Chriſt gaue now aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by the work of the Miniſterie to gather and build his Church. For as an Apoſtle is diſtinguiſhed from a Prophet, a Prophet from an Euangeliſt, ſo an Euangeliſt from an ordinary Teacher.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be ſaid, they were not diſtinct, but that the ſuperiour contained the inferiour, and Apoſtles might be Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts properly, as <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That former point is to be underſtood with a graine of ſalt. The ſuperiour contained the inferiour virtually and eminently, in as much as they could doe <hi>altiori tamen ratione,</hi> what the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did. This ſenſe is tollerable. But that formallie the power of all other offices ſuites which the Apoſtles is falſe. My Lord chiefe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of England is not formally a Conſtable. As for the latter, true, an Apoſtle might be alſo a penman of the Goſpell, but this maketh not an Euangeliſt no more then an Apoſtle, but doth <hi>per accidens,</hi> come to them both. And even as a Preacher or Paſtor, writing Commentaries, and publiſhing other Treatiſes, this cometh <hi>per acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> to his calling, it doth not make him a Paſtor, but more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2189:26"/>
and fruitfull in that regard then another. So <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> was not therefore Euangeliſts becauſe they did write the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, for then none ſhould haue been Euangeliſts that had not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but in this regard they were more renowmed then other. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome hath ſo prevailed, ſaith <hi>Maldonate</hi> in his Preface on <hi>Matthew,</hi> that we call them Euangeliſts, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Writers of the Goſpels) whom the Scriptures never call Euangeliſts. Theſe Euangeliſts <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of were given at Chriſts aſcenſion, but the firſt writer of the Goſpell, being an Apoſtle, was at leaſt eight yeares after. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they were a diſtinct order of workemen from the Apoſtles, but two of the penmen of the Goſpels were Apoſtles. Thirdly, they were ſuch as by labour of miniſterie (common for the generall of it to all the other) did gather Saints, and build Chriſts Bodie. Now writing the Goſpell was not a labour of Miniſterie common to Apoſtles, Prophets, Euangeliſts, Paſtors, but the publiſhing of it.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe degrees which Chriſt did diſtinctly giue to otherſome, and otherſome, thoſe he did not giue conjoynedly to one and the ſame perſons. But theſe callings he gaue to ſome one, to others another. Elſe he muſt haue ſaid, he gaue the ſame men to be Apoſtles and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, the ſame to be Euangeliſts and Paſtors. Ergo.</p>
                  <p>That Calling which is not compatible with the Calling of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt, that <hi>Paul</hi> never annexed to an Euangeliſt. But the Calling of a Biſhop is ſuch. For a Biſhop is tyed to a particular Church. The Calling of an Euangeliſt is a Calling whereby one is called to the worke of the Miniſterie, to gather Saints, and edifie, Chriſts body, without any limitation to any particular Church. Ergo, <hi>Paul</hi> never annexed the Calling of a Biſhop to an Euangeliſt.</p>
                  <p>The Calling of an Euangeliſt is not to write the Goſpell, nor to preach it ſimply: for then every Miniſter of the Word ſhould be an Euangeliſt. But this doth difference them, to preach it without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation or aſſignation to any particular church. Thus <hi>Phillip,</hi> thus all thoſe who were the Apoſtles helpers, working the work of the Lord as they did were Euang. of which ſort ſome continued to the time of <hi>Commodus</hi> the Emperour, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> reporteth, <hi>Euſeb. hiſt. li.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. Now a Calling wherby I am thus called to publiſh the Goſpel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fixing my ſelfe in any certain place; and a Calling which bindeth during life to ſettle my ſelfe in one Church, are incompatible.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, that which would haue debaſed <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> did not put upon them. But to haue brought them from the honour of ſerving the Goſpell, as <hi>Collaterall</hi> companions of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, to be ordinary Paſtors, had abaſed them. Ergo, this to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Paſtors <hi>Paul</hi> did not put upon them. <hi>Obj.</hi> The aſſumption is denyed, it was no abaſement. For before they were but Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and afterward by impoſition of hands were made Biſhops.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2189:27"/>
why ſhould they receiue impoſition of hands, and a new ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they did not receiue an ordinarie calling? we meane if they were not admitted into ordinary functions by impoſition of hands. I anſwer, This denyall with all whereon it is builded is groſſe: For, to bring them from a Superiour order to an Inferiour, is to abaſe them. But the Euangeliſts office was ſuperiour to Paſtors. Ergo. The aſſumption proved. Firſt, Every office is ſo much the greater, by how much the power of it is of ampler extent and leſſe reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But the Euangeliſts power of teaching and governing was il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitted. Ergo. The aſſumption proved. Where ever an Apoſtle did that part of Gods worke which belonged to an Apoſtle; there an Euangeliſt might doe that which belonged to him. But that part of Gods work which belonged to an Apoſtle he might doe any where, without limitation. Ergo. Secondly, Every Miniſter by how much <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e doth more approximate to the higheſt, by ſo much he is higher. But the companions, &amp; coadjutors of the Apoſtles, were neerer then ordinarie Paſtors. Ergo. Who are next the King, in his Kingdome, but thoſe who are <hi>Regis Comites.</hi> The Euangeliſts were <hi>Comites</hi> of theſe Eccleſiaſticall Cheiftaines. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth expreſly ſay on <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. That the Euangeliſts in an ambulatorie courſe ſpreading the Goſpell, were aboue any Biſhop or Paſtor which reſteth in a certain Church. Wherefore to make them Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters is a weake conceite. For, every Preſbyter (properly ſo called) was conſtituted in a certain Church to doe the work of the Lord in a certaine Church. But Euangeliſts were not, but to doe the worke of the Lord in any Church as they ſhould be occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Ergo, they were no Preſbyters properly ſo called. Now for their ordination; <hi>Timothie</hi> received none as the Doctor conceiveth, but what hee had from the hand of the Apoſtle and Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, when now he was taken of <hi>Paul</hi> to be his companion. For no doubt but the Church which gaue him a good teſtimony, did by her Preſbyters concurre with <hi>Paul</hi> in his promoting to that office. Obj. What, could they lay on hands with the Apoſtles, which <hi>Philip</hi> could not, and could they enter one into an extraordinary office? Anſ. They did lay on hands with the Apoſtles, as it is expreſly read, both of the Apoſtles and them. It is one thing to uſe preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie impoſition, another to uſe miraculous impoſition, ſuch as the Apoſtles did, whereby the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt were conferred. In the firſt, Preſbyters haue power. Neither is it certaine, that <hi>Phillip</hi> could not haue impoſed hands, and given the Holy Ghoſt. For though he could, he might chooſe in wiſedom for their greater confirmation and edification to let that bee done by perſons more eminent. Finally, impoſition of hands may be uſed in promoting and ſetting one forth to an extraordinarie office.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2189:27"/>
For every extraordinarie office is not attended with immediate vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from God. As the calling of Evangeliſts, though extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, was in this unlike the calling of Apoſtles and Prophets.! Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, men called immediatly may be promoted to the more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full exerciſe of their immediate and extraordinarie callings by impoſition of hands from their inferiours, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were. Howſoever, it is plaine, that <hi>Timothie</hi> by impoſition of hands, was ordained to no calling, but the calling of an Evangeliſt. For that calling he was ordained to which he is called on by <hi>Paul</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and fully execute. But hee is called on by him to doe the work of an Evangeliſt. Ergo, that calling he was ordained to.</p>
                  <p>That work which exceedeth the calling of an ordinarie Biſhop, was not put upon an ordinarie Biſhop. But <hi>Titus</hi> his work did ſo: for it was to plant Preſbyters towne by towne through a Nation. Ergo. For the ordinarie plantation and erecting of Churches to their due frame, exceedeth the calling of an ordinarie Biſhop. But this was <hi>Titus</hi> his worke. Ergo. Biſhops are given to particular Churches when now they are framed, that they may keepe them winde and wether tight, they are not to lay foundations, or to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie ſome imperfect beginnings. But ſay <hi>Titus</hi> had been a Biſhop: he is no warrant for ordinarie Biſhops, but for Primates, whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie did reach through whole Ilands. Nay, if the Doctors rule out of <hi>Theodoret</hi> were good, it would ſerve for a Biſhop of the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie cut. For it is ſayd he placed Preſbyters citie by citie, or town by towne, who are in name onely Biſhops, but not that hee placed Angels, or Apoſtles, in any part of it. He therefore was the ſole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of them, the teſt were but Preſbyters, ſuch as had the name, not the office and government of Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>Finally, were it granted that they were ordinarie Biſhops, and written to doe the things that Biſhops doe, yet would it not bee a ground for their majoritie of power in matter ſacramentall and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, as is aboue excepted.</p>

The aſſumption is plaine: for if the Church had Metropolitans ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and from the beginning, as the Councell of Nice teſtifieth, much more Biſhops. For Dioceſan Biſhops muſt be before them, they riſing of combination of Cities and Diocies.

Again, <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth teſtifie, that long before his time, Biſhops were placed in all provinces and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, beſides the ſucceſſion of Biſhops from the Apoſtles times: for they prove their originall to haue been in the Apoſtles times.

                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, we deny the propoſition. For firſt; this doth preſuppoſe ſuch an aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit with the Church, that ſhe cannot gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally take up any cuſtome, or opinion, but what hath Apoſtolicall warrant, whereas the contrary may be ſhewed in many inſtances. Keeping of holy dayes was a generall practiſe through the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, before any Councell enacted it, yet was no Apoſtolicall tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Socrat. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. <hi>Evangelium non impoſuit hoc, ut dies feſti obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventur, ſed homines ipſi ſuis quique locis ex more quodam introduxerunt.</hi> Taking the Euchariſt faſting, the faſts on wedneſday, and Saturday, faſting in ſome faſhion before Eaſter, ceremonies in Baptiſing, the government of Metropolitans were generally received before any Councel eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It doth preſuppoſe, that the Church cannot generally conſpire in taking up any cuſtome, if ſhe be not led into it by ſome generall proponent, as a generall repreſentative Councell, or the Apoſtles, who were Oecumenicall Doctors, but I ſee no reaſon for ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 This doth preſuppoſe, that ſomething may bee which is of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall authoritie, which neither directly nor conſequentlie is included in the word written. For when there are ſome cuſtomes which haue been generall, which yet cannot bee grounded in the word written, it is neceſſarie by this propoſition, that ſome things
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2189:28"/>
may be in the Church having authoritie Apoſtolicall, as being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by word unwritten. For they cannot haue warrant from the the Apoſtles but by word written or unwritten. To the proofe, we anſwer: That of <hi>Tertullian</hi> maketh not to the purpoſe, for hee ſpeaketh of that which was in Churches Apoſtolicall, as they were now planted by them, which the ſentence at large ſet downe will make cleare. <hi>Si conſtat id bonum quod prius, &amp; id prius quod eſt ab ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, ab initio quod ab Apoſtolis, pariter uti<expan>

                  </p>
                  <p>Wee anſwer to the aſſumption two things: Firſt, it cannot bee proved, that univerſally there were ſuch Dioceſan Biſhops as ours. For in the Apoſtles times it cannot bee proved, that Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which they planted were divided into a mother Church, and ſome Parochiall Churches. Now while they governed together in common with Preſbyters, and that but one congregation, they could not bee like our Dioceſan Biſhops. And though there bee doubtfull relations, that Rome was divided under <hi>Eva<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iſtus,</hi> yet this was not common through the Church. For <hi>Tripartite</hi> ſtory teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that till the time of <hi>Sozomen,</hi> they did in ſome parts continue together. Trip. hiſt. lib. 1. cap. 19. Secondly, thoſe Biſhops which had no more but one Deacon to helpe them in their miniſterie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their Churches, they could not be Dioceſan Biſhops. But ſuch in many parts the Apoſtles planted, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doth teſtifie. Ergo.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2189:29"/>
Thirdly, ſuch Countries as did uſe to have Biſhops in villages and little towns, could not have Dioceſan Biſhops. But ſuch there were after the Apoſtles times in Cyprus and Arabia, as <hi>Sozom.</hi> in his 7. book, cap. 10. teſtifieth. Ergo, Dioceſan Biſhops were never ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally received. Secondly, Biſhops came to bee common by a Councell, ſayth <hi>Ambroſe, Proſpiciente Concilio. Amb. in</hi> 4. <hi>ad Eph.</hi> or by a Decree paſſing through the world: <hi>toto orbe decretum eſt,</hi> ſayth <hi>Ierom ad Evag.</hi> which is to be conſidered, not of one Oecumenicall Councell, but diſtributively, in that ſingular Churches did in their Preſbyteries decree, and that ſo, that one for the moſt part followed another in it. This <hi>interpretativè,</hi> though not <hi>formalitèr,</hi> is a generall decree. But to thinke this was a decree of <hi>Pauls,</hi> is too too abſurd. For beſides that the Scripture would not have omitted a decree of ſuch importance, as tended to the alteration of and conſummation of the frame of Churches begun through all the world, How could <hi>Ierom</hi> (if this decree were the Apoſtles) conclude that Biſhops were aboue Preſbyters, <hi>magis conſuetudine Eccleſiae,</hi> then <hi>Dominicae diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis veritate.</hi> If the Doct. do except, that <hi>cuſtome</hi> is here put for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall inſtitution</hi>; let him put in one for the other, and ſee how well it will become the ſenſe. <hi>Let Biſhops know they are greater then Prieſts, rather by the Decree of the Apostle, then by the truth of Chriſts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition.</hi> Is it not fine, that the Apoſtles ſhould be brought in as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites, facing Chriſt their Lord? And this concluſion of <hi>Ierom</hi> doth make me think that <hi>decretum eſt</hi> imported no more, then that it was took up in time for cuſtome through the world. Which is elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to be a decree, becauſe cuſtome groweth in time to obtaine <hi>vim legis,</hi> the force of a decree. But <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his place is plain, <hi>Proſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciente Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cilio,</hi> he meaneth not a councel held by Apoſtles. For he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this proviſion by Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel to haue come in, when now in Egypt &amp; Alexandria, Preſbyters according to the cuſtome of that Church, were not found fit to ſucceed each other, but they choſe out of their preſbyteries men of beſt deſert. Now to <hi>Heraclas</hi> and <hi>Donyſius,</hi> ther were a ſucceſſion of Preſbyters in the Church of Alexandria, as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> both affirme. Wherefore briefly, ſeeing no ſuch u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall cuſtome can be proved, all the godly fathers never conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to aboliſh Chriſts inſtitution. Secondly, could a cuſtome have prevailed with all of them, whom we have to <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, yet it might enter and ſteale upon them through humaine frailtie, as theſe errours in doctrine did upon many otherwiſe godly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Martyrs: the rather becauſe the alteration was ſo little at the firſt, and Ariſtocraticall government was ſtill continued. Thirdly, ſay, they had wittingly and willingly done it through the world, they had not coſpired, becauſe they might haue deemed ſuch power in the Church, and themſelves to doe nothing but what they might
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2189:29"/>
with Chriſts good liking for the edification of it. How many of the chiefe Patrons of this cauſe, are at this day of this iudgement, that if it were but an Apoſtolical inſtitution, as Apoſtolical is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed to divine, they might change it. But if the Apoſtles did enact this order, as Legats and Embaſſadors of Chriſt, then is it not theirs, but Chriſts own inſtitution. What an Embaſſador ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as an Embaſſadour, it is principally from him that ſent him: but if they who were Legates, did not bearing the perſon of Legats, but of ordinary Eccleſiaſticall governours, decree this; then it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, Church governours may alter it without treaſonable conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe proofes, that Biſhops have been throughout all Churches from the beginning, they are weak. For firſt, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Nice uſeth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> but <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der happily to that time wherein the cuſtome began, which was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known to them then to us: the phraſe is ſo uſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.8. in reſpect of ſome things which had not continued many years. They cannot meane the Apoſtles times, for then Metropolitans ſhould haue actuallie been from the Apoſtles time. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the phraſe of the Councell of Epheſus, is likewiſe aequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; for they have reference to the fathers of Nice, or at leaſt the decrees of the fathers, who went before the Councell of Nice. For thoſe words being added, <hi>definitiones Nicenae fidei,</hi> ſeeme to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine the former, <hi>Canones Apoſtolorum.</hi> It is plaine the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Councell doth aſcribe this thing onely to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtome, no leſſe then that of Nice, Conſtantinople and Chalcedon; and therefore cannot riſe to the authoritie of ſacred Scriptures. Let him ſhew in all antiquitie where ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are called Canons of the Apoſtles. Finally, if this phraſe note rules given by the Apoſtles, then the Apoſtles themſelves did ſet out the bounds of Cyprus and Antioch. As for the authoritie of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> he doth teſtifie what was <hi>Communiter</hi> in his time, Biſhops ordained in cities; not <hi>univerſaliter,</hi> as if there were no citie but had ſome. Secondly, he ſpeaketh of Biſhops who had their Churches included in Cities, not more then might meet together in one, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny common deliberations. They had no Dioceſan Churches, nor were Biſhops who had majoritie of rule over their Preſbyters, nor ſole power of ordination. As for the Catalogue of ſucceſſion, it is <hi>pompae aptior quam pugnae</hi>; Rome can recite their ſucceſſours. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath had Biſhops, Ergo, Oecumenicall Biſhops is no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. All who are named Biſhops in the Catalogue, were not of one cut, and in that ſence we controvert.</p>
                  <p>Touching that which doth improve their being conſtituted by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Councell, it is very weak. For though wee read of no generall

Councell, yet there might be, and the report not come to us. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we have ſhewed, that the Councell of Nice doth not prove this, that Biſhops were every where from the beginning; the phraſe of <hi>from the beginning,</hi> beeing there reſpectively, not abſolutely u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Neither doth <hi>Ierom</hi> ever contrary this: for he doth not uſe thoſe words in proprietie, but by way of alluſion; otherwiſe if hee did think the Apoſtle had publiſhed this decree, when the firſt to the Corinths was written, how can he cite teſtimonies long after writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to prove that Biſhops were not inſtituted in the Apoſtles time, but that they were ordained by the Church <hi>iure Eccleſiaſtico,</hi> when the time ſerved for it.</p>

                  <p>An order is reputed higher, either becauſe intrinſecallie it hath a higher vertue, or becauſe it hath a higher degree of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and honour.

                     </gap>, as the Councell of Sardica ſpeaketh. Which is further proved: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavſe the fathers did not hold a Biſhop to differ from a Presbyter, as Presbyter from a Deacon. For theſe differ <hi>genere proximo; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verint Diaconi ſe ad miniſterium non ad ſacerdotium vocari.</hi> But a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop differeth from a Presbyter, as from one who hath the power of Prieſthood no leſſe then himſelfe, and therefore the difference betwixt theſe, muſt bee circumſtantiall, not ſo eſſentiall as betwixt the other. Thus Biſhops and Archbiſhops are divers orders of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, not that one exceedeth the other, as a power of higher vertue, but of higher dignitie then then the other.

to the common tenent of antiquitie, or the Schoole, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is maintained by ſuch as hold the Character of a Prieſt and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop inwardlie. diverſe one from the other. For as a Biſhop differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in power and degree from an Archbiſhop. Becauſe nothing an Archbiſhop can doe, as confirming, conſecrating Biſhops, &amp;c. but a Biſhop can doe alſo. So neither doth a Preſbyter from a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But the Prieſt cannot ordaine a Preſbyter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme as the Biſhop doth, and therefore differeth <hi>poteſtate gradus.</hi> To this I anſwer, that theſe authours meane not this difference in power (<hi>de fundamentali &amp; remota poteſtate, ſed ampliata, immediata, et iam actu horum effectuum productiva</hi>) as if Preſbyters had not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and fundamentall power to doe thoſe things: but that they haue not, before they be ordained biſhops, their power ſo enlarged, as to produce theſe effects actuallie. As a boy hath the generative facultie while he is a child, which he hath when he is a man, but yet it is not in a child free from all impediment, that it can actually beget the like. But this is too much to grant. For the power ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall in the Prieſt, is an actuall power which hee is able to performe and execute, nothing defectiue in regard of them, further then they be with-held from the exerciſe of it. For that cauſe which ſtandeth in compleat actualitie to greater &amp; more noble effects, hath an inferior &amp; leſſer of the ſame kind under it alſo, unleſſe the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the matter be intercepted. Thus a preſbyter he hath a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental power ſtanding in ful actualitie to higher ſacramental ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; therfore cannot but have theſe inferior of confirmation and orders in his power, further then they are excepted &amp; kept from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in applied to him. And therfore power ſacramentall cannot bee in a Presbyter, as the generative facultie is in a child, for this is inchoate onely, and imperfect, ſuch as cannot produce that effect. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Prieſt is compleat. Secondlie, I ſay, theſe are no ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall actions. Thirdlie, were they, yet as much may bee ſaid to prove an Archbiſhop a diſtinct order from a Biſhop, as to prove a Presbyter and Biſhop differing in order. For it is proper to him out of power to generate a Biſhop, other Biſhops laying on hands, no otherwiſe then Presbyters are ſaid to doe, where they ioyne with their Biſhops. If that rule ſtand not <hi>maior ad minori,</hi> nor yet <hi>equalis ab equali,</hi> I marvel how Biſhops can beget Biſhops equal, yea ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to them, as in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrating the Lord Archbiſhop, &amp; yet a preſbyter may not ordain a presbyter. It doth not ſtand with their Epiſcopall majoritie, that the rule (<hi>every one may give that which be hath</hi>) ſhould hold here in the exerciſe of their power. Thoſe who are in one order, may differ <hi>jure <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>o</hi> or <hi>humane. Aaron</hi> differed from the Prieſts not in power ſacramentall, for they might all offer incence, and make interceſſion. But the ſolumne interceſſion in the holy of holies
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2189:31"/>
God did except and appropriate to the high Prieſt the type of Chriſt. Prieſts would haue reached to this power of interceſſion in the holy place, or any act of like kinde: but that God did not permit that this ſhould come under them, or they intermeddle in it. Thus by humane law the Biſhop is greater in exerciſe then the Prieſt. For though God hath not excepted any thing from the one free to the other, yet commonly confirmation, ordination, abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by impoſing hands in receiving Penitents, conſecrating Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Virgines, haue been referred to the Biſhop for the honour of Prieſthood, rather then any neceſſity of law, as <hi>Ierome</hi> ſpeaketh. Finally, in dignity, thoſe may differ many wayes, who in degree are equall, which is granted by our adverſaries in this cauſe. Yea, they ſay, in amplitude of juriſdiction, as in which it is apparant an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop exceedeth another. But were it manifeſt that God did giue Biſhops Paſtorall power through their Dioceſſe, and an Archbiſhop through his Province, though but when he viſiteth, this would make one differ in order from the other; as in this regard Euangeliſts differred from ordinary Paſtors. But that juriſdiction is in one more then another, is not eſtabliſhed, nor hath apparencie in any Scripture.</p>
                  <p>To the proofes therefore I anſwer briefly: the one may be a ſtep to the other, while they differ in degrees of dignities, though eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially they are but one and the ſame order. In this regard it may be ſacriledge to reduce one, from the greater to the leſſer, if he haue not deſerved it. As for that of <hi>Ierom</hi> it is moſt plain, he did meane no further order, but onely in reſpect of ſome dignities wherewith they inveſted their Biſhop, or firſt Preſbyter, as that they did mount him up in a higher ſeate, the reſt ſitting lower about him, and gaue him this preheminence, to ſit firſt, as a Conſul in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and moderate the carriage of things amongſt them: this <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiori gradu,</hi> being nothing but his honourable <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting ſole authoritie. For by a Canon of the Councill of Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea, we finde that the Biſhop had this priviledge to ſit firſt, though Preſbyters did together with him enter, and ſit as Iudges of equall commiſſion. For though Deacons ſtood, Preſbyters did alwaies ſit <hi>in circuitu Epiſcopi.</hi>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2189:32"/>
may be added a third. That which <hi>Moſes</hi> and the 70 Seniors were, that are the Biſhops and Preſbyters. Firſt, for the propoſition it is not true, for firſt of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes, they were not orders dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent eſſentially in their power, but onely in degree of dignitie, wherein the high Prieſt was aboue others. For every Prieſts power would haue reached to that act which was reſerved to the high Prieſt onely. Beſides, when the high Prieſt was deceaſed or removed, the other Prieſts did conſecrate the ſucceſſour, as <hi>Sadock.</hi> Finally, the one had for ſubſtance the ſame conſecration that the other, neither had the high Prieſt any maiorite of directiue or correctiue power over others. So the Apoſtles, and 72, will not be found different in order; and therefore thoſe who reſemble theſe cannot be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be of divers orders. For the Apoſtles and 72, differ no more then ordinary meſſengers who are imployed in a ſet courſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſent by occaſion onely: They were both meſſengers, the Apoſtles <hi>habitu</hi> and abidingly, the other in act onely, and after a tranſitorie manner.</p>
                  <p>Againe, had <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes been divers orders, differing eſſentially in the inward power of them, yet is not the propoſition true, but with addition in this wiſe. Thoſe who are identically and formally that which <hi>Aaron</hi> and the Apoſtles were, and that which his ſonnes, and the 72 were, they differ in degree eſſentially, not thoſe who were this analogically by reaſon of ſome imperfect reſemblance. For things may be ſaid to be thoſe things wherewith they haue but imperfect ſimilitude. In this ſenſe onely the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is true.</p>
                  <p>Now to come to the aſſumption. Firſt, touching <hi>Aaron,</hi> wee deny any Biſhop is as <hi>Aaron</hi> by divine Inſtitution, or by perfect ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude anſwering to him. But becauſe <hi>Aaron</hi> was the firſt and high Prieſt, others inferiour: ſo it hath pleaſed the Church to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this pollicie, and make the Biſhop, as it were <hi>Primum Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> or <hi>Antiſtitem in primo ordine,</hi> Preſbyters <hi>in ſecundo,</hi> Whence Biſhops may be ſaid to be that which <hi>Aaron</hi> was through the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ordination, which ſhe framed, looking to this patterne of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which God himſelfe had ſet out in the old Teſtament. The fathers call them <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes onely for ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon analogie, which through the ordinance of the Church aroſe betwixt the Biſhop and Preſbyters, and them; and conceiue them to be ſo by humane accommodation, not by divine inſtitution. But that they were ſo properly ſucceeding them as orders of Miniſterie typified by them by Gods owne appointment, this the fathers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought. Chriſts prieſthood, no mans, was properly typified in <hi>Aaron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:2189:32"/>So touching the other part of the aſſumption. That Biſhops and Preſbyters are what Apoſtles, and the 72 were. The fathers, many of them, inſiſt in this proportion, that as the Apoſtles and 72 were teachers, the one in a higher, the other in an inferiour or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo Biſhops and Preſbyters, were by the Churches ordinance. This is the fathers phraſe, to call them Apoſtles, who in any manner reſemble the Apoſtles, to call them, as <hi>Ambroſe. Prophets, Euangeliſts, Paſtors, Doctors,</hi> who reſemble theſe, and come in ſome common analogie neereſt them, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the 70 Seniors, who in any ſort reſembled them. Now the aſſumption granted in this ſenſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not againſt us. For they might be ſaid theſe, if there were but diverſe degrees of dignity amongſt them, though for power of order by Gods inſtitution they were all one. But ſome ſtreyne it further, and take it, that Chriſt inſtituting thoſe two orders, did in ſo doing, inſtitute Biſhops and Preſbyters, the one wherof ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Apoſtles, the other the 72, and that thus the Fathers take it. To which I anſwer, Firſt, in generall, this analogie of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and 72, is not generally affected by them all. <hi>Ignatius ad Smyrnenſes dicit Apoſtolis Preſbyteros ſucceſſiſſe, Diaconos</hi> 72, <hi>diſcipulis. Clem. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Conſt. cap.</hi> 30. ſaith, That Biſhops anſwer to God the Father, Preſbyters to Chriſt, Deacons to the Apoſtles. <hi>Ierom</hi> doth manifeſtly make Preſbyters (whom hee alſo calleth by name of Biſhops in that Epiſtle, where hee maintaineth the Preſbyters dignity) ſucceſſours to the Apoſtles. The like hath <hi>Cyprian, Apoſtolos id eſt Epiſcopos &amp; prepoſitos,</hi> that is, <hi>ordinis ratione prepoſitos minorum Eccleſiarum,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaketh, elſe it ſhould bee all one with the former: when hee maketh the Preſbyter as well as the Biſhop to be ordained in the Apoſtles. Finally, theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who take the 72 to haue beene Apoſtles, as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, could not imagine this proportion of diverſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſet up in them. Secondly, if Chriſt in theſe inſtituted thoſe other, it muſt bee one of theſe waies. Firſt, hee did make theſe not onely Apoſtles, but Biſhops, and ſo the 72, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his meſſengers for the time, but Preſbyters alſo. Or, ſecondly, elſe hee did ordaine theſe as he did raine <hi>Manna,</hi> noting and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuring as by a type, a further thing which hee would worke: <hi>viz.</hi> that he would inſtitute Biſhops and Preſbyters for Teachers ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in his Church: but both theſe are <hi>gatis</hi> ſpoken, without any foundation or reaſon. For the firſt, we haue ſhewed that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles could not bee Biſhops ordinarily; nor yet the calling of theſe ſeventie two (which was to goe through all Cities Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing) ſtand with Preſbyters, Preſbyters being given to Churches <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and there fixed. Neither can the latter be true: for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2189:33"/>
then Chriſt ſhould haue giuen a Sacrament, when he ordained his Apoſtles, and ſent forth his 72. Secondly, the type or the ſhadow is leſſe then the thing typified, the ſubſtance of it. But the giving Apoſtles was a greater thing then giving ordinary Paſtors. Ergo. Thirdly, I ſay, that Chriſt did never ordaine that any ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Apoſtles, or the 72, in regard of their order. There is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſucceſſion, <hi>in gradum,</hi> or <hi>in Caput,</hi> as the juriſts diſtinguiſh. <hi>In gradum eundem,</hi> as when one brother dying, another brother doth ſucceed him in the inheritance. <hi>In caput,</hi> as when one not of the ſame degree and line doth come after another, as when a brother dying another doth inherite after him, not a brother, but a coſin to him. Thus the Apoſtles haue no ſucceſſors ſucceeding them <hi>in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> but ſuch onely as follow them, being of other degrees, and in another line, as it were, in which ſort euery Paſtor doth ſucceed them. But then they are ſaid to ſucceed them, becauſe they follow them, and after a ſort reſemble them, not becauſe they hold the places which the Apoſtles did properly. <hi>Apostolo in quantum eſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolus non ſucceditur, Legato quatenus est Legatus non ſucceditur.</hi> Fourthly, that the Preſbyters doe as perſons of a diverſe order ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Apoſtles no leſſe fully then any other. Firſt, they muſt needs ſucceed them who are ſpoken to in them, whoſe duties are laid downe in that which the Apoſtles received in commandement. But the Preſbyters were ſpoken to both in the Keyes, in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in the commandement of teaching and baptizing. Ergo, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters muſt needs ſucceed the Apoſtles. Secondly, thoſe whom the Apoſtles did inſtitute in the Churches, which they had planted for their further building them up, they were their next ſucceſſors. But the Apoſtles did commend the Churches to the care of Preſbyters who might build them up, whom they had now converted. Ergo, theſe were their ſucceſſors moſt proper and immediate. Thirdly, theſe to whom now taking their farewels they reſigned the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, theſe were their ſucceſſours. But this they did to Preſbyters, <hi>Paul</hi> now never to ſee Epheſus more <hi>Act.</hi> 20, <hi>Peter</hi> neere death, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. Ergo. Fourthly, if one Paſtor or Miniſter doe more properly reſemble an Apoſtle then another, it is becauſe hee hath ſome power Apoſtolique more fully conveyed to him then to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther But this was not done. Ergo. The aſſumption is manifeſt: for. Firſt, their power of teaching and miniſtring the Sacraments doth as fully and properly belong to the Preſbyter as to any, unleſſe we count Preaching not neceſſarily connexed to a Preſbyters office, but a Biſhops; or at leaſt that a more rudimentall preaching belongs to a Preſbyter, the more full and exact teaching being appropriate to the Biſhop, which are both too abſurd. Secondly, for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Apoſtles did no more giue the power of government to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2189:33"/>
one then to another. <hi>Obj.</hi> This is denyed, for the Apoſtles are ſaid to haue kept the power of ordination, and the coerciue power in their own hands, &amp; to haue committed theſe in the end onely to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique men, as <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> who were their ſucceſſors ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them in it. <hi>Anſ.</hi> A notable fiction: for it is moſt plain by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that ordination, power of deciding controverſies, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, were given to Preſbyters, and not kept up from them; they ſhould otherwiſe haue provided ill for the Churches which they left to their care. Secondly, if the Apoſtles did commit ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power of government to ſome men aboue others, in which regard they ſhould be their ſucceſſours, then the Apoſtles did not onely enjoy as <hi>Legates</hi> power over the Churches, but as ordinarie Miniſters. For what power they enjoyed as <hi>Legates,</hi> this they could not <hi>aliis Legare.</hi> Power as ordinary Paſtors in any Nations or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches they never reſerved, and therefore did never ſubſtitute others to themſelues in that which they never exerciſed nor enjoyed. And it is to be noted, that this opinion of Epiſcopall ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles is grounded on this, that the Apoſtles were not onely Apoſtles, but Biſhops in Provinces and particular Churches. For the Papiſts themſelues urged with this, that the Apoſtles haue none ſucceeding them, they doe conſider a double reſpect in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the one of <hi>Legates,</hi> ſo <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any other could haue a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour. The other of Biſhops <hi>Oecumenicall</hi> in <hi>Peter,</hi> of Biſhops National or Dioceſan, as in ſome other. Thus onely conſidered, they grant them to haue other Biſhops ſucceeding them: For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick power preciſely conſidered, was <hi>Privilegium perſonale ſimul cum perſona extinctum.</hi> Now we haue proved that this ground is falſe, and therefore that ſucceding the Apoſtles, more appropriate to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops then other Miniſters grounded upon it, is falſe alſo.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the Preſbyters cannot be ſaid ſucceſſors of the 72. For firſt, in all that is ſpoken to the 72, the full dutie and office of a Presbyter is not laid downe. Secondly, it doth not appeare that they had any ordinarie power of preaching or baptizing and miniſtering the other Sacrament. For they are ſent to Evangelize, to preach the Goſpell: but whether from power of ordinarie office, or from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and delegation onely for this preſent occaſion it is doubtful. Thirdly, it is not read that tney ever baptized, or had the power of adminiſtring the Supper given to them: Yea, that they had neither miniſterie of Word or Sacraments <hi>ex officio ordinario,</hi> ſeemeth hence plaine; That the Apoſtles did chooſe them to the Deacons care, which was ſo cumberſome that themſelues could not tend the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Word with it, much leſſe then could theſe not having ſuch extraordinarie gifts as the Apoſtles had. Fourthly, if they were ſet Miniſters, then were they Euangeliſts in deſtination. For the act
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2189:34"/>
enjoyned them, is from Citie to Citie, without limitation to Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelize; and after we reade of ſome, as <hi>Phillip,</hi> that he was an Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt; the ſame is in Eccleſiaſticall ſtorie teſtified of ſome others. Thus we Preſbyters ſhould ſucceed Euangeliſts thoſe Apoſtolique men whom the Apoſtles conſtituted Biſhops, and by conſequence be the true ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles. Theſe Euangeliſts ſucceeded them by all grant, we ſucceed theſe. Finally, <hi>Armachanus</hi> doth take theſe 72 to haue been ordinary diſciples, in his 7 <hi>Book Armenicarum quaeſt. cap.</hi> 7.</p>

It may be ſaid, there muſt be but one Biſhop in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to all the other Churches of the Cities. Secondly, this may be affirmed as ſtanding by Canon, or as divine inſtitution. Now the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is true, onely by Law Eccleſiaſticall. For the Scripture is ſaid to haue placed Preſbyters who did <hi>Superintendere, Act.</hi> 20. and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2189:34"/>
that there were Biſhops at <hi>Philippi.</hi> True it is, the Scripture doth not diſtinguiſh how manie of the one ſort, nor how many of the other, becauſe no doubt for the number of the Congregations, a ſingle Preſbyter labouring in the Word, or two, the one coadjutor to the other might be placed. Secondly, it is teſtified by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarilie all Cities but <hi>Alexandria</hi> had two. Thirdly, <hi>Ierom</hi> on 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. doth ſaie, that now indeed there may be but one Biſhop, meaning Canonicallie, making a difference twixt the preſent time and time Apoſtolique. Fourthlie, <hi>Auſtin,</hi> did not know it was unlawfull: Yea he did onelie in regard of the decree of Nice account it ſo. <hi>Ep.</hi> 110. neither did Church or people ever except againſt the contrary, but as a point againſt Canon, which might in ſome caſes be diſpenſed with, as the ſtorie of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Liberius,</hi> and <hi>Foelix</hi> doth more then manifeſt. For though the people of Rome cried out one God, one Chriſt, one Biſhop, yet they yeelded at their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ſuite, wheras had it been a thing they had all thought to haue been againſt Chriſts inſtitution, they would not haue done. <hi>Vide Soz. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.

               <p>Thoſe who had peereleſſe power aboue others in ordination and juriſdiction, they were ſuch as had preheminence and majority of rule over others. But the former is due to Biſhops.

                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>I anſwer the Propoſition of the firſt Sillogiſme by diſtinction. Thoſe who haue peereleſſe power in regard of the ſimple right to ordeine; viz. in regard of exerciſing the act, and ſole performing the rite of it, thoſe who haue a right to theſe things originally from Chriſt and his Apoſtles which no others haue, they are aboue others in degree. Againe, peereleſſe power in a Biſhop over Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters may be ſaid in compariſon to them diſtributiuely or collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely conſidered. Hee that hath peereleſſe power given him which no one of the other hath, is not preſently of a greater degree, nor hath not majoritie of rule amongſt others, as a Conſul in the Senate: But if he haue a peereleſſe power, ſuch as they all collectiuely conſidered, cannot controule, then the Propoſition is true; but the Aſſumption will then be found to halt.</p>
                  <p>To the proofe of the aſſumption. The Propoſition is true of power in order to the thing it ſelfe, not to miniſtring the rite, and executing the act, which may be reſerved for honour ſake to one, by thoſe who otherwiſe haue equall power with him. That Biſhops haue this power in order, the thing it ſelfe agreeing to them, <hi>Vipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prii officii,</hi> not by commiſſion from others, we deny. The aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is wholly denyed. As for the proofe of it. Firſt, we that deny that Euangeliſts had not power to ordeyne, as well as Apoſtles. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that Preſbyters had not this power in a Church planted as well as they. Euery one as fellow ſervants might conſpire in the ſame ordination. The Euangeliſts power did not derogate from the Apoſtles, the Preſbyters from neither of them. But power of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing hands ſolitarily, whereas yet Churches were not conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, this may happily be appropriated to the Apoſtles and Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, whoſe office it was to labour in erecting the frame of chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Secondly, the aſſumption is falſe; in denying that it was in the power of Preſbyters to lay on hands, contrarie to that in <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie: The grace given thee by laying on of the hands of the Preſbytery.</hi> Thirdly, it is falſe, in preſuppoſing others then Preſbyters to haue been <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> their ſucceſſors. To the proofe of this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. The propoſition is not true: For it might be convenient that the ſame thing ſhould be done by Euangeliſts, and by ordinary Paſtors, each concurring in their ſeverall orders to the ſame ſervice of Chriſt the Lord. Secondly, I anſwer to the aſſumption. That Preſbyters were to bee placed in Churches framed where there were Preſbyters, or where there were as yet none. In the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2189:35"/>
firſt Churches, they are bid ordaine if any need further, but <hi>ſalvo jure Eccleſia</hi>; not without the concurrence of others. In the latter Churches which were to be conſtituted, they may be conceived sa Evangeliſts, with ſole power of ſetting Presbyters forth by this rite of impoſition of hands. Wee hold Apoſtles might doe it, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts might, and the Presbyteries alſo. Yea Presbyters in Alexandria when now their firſt Presbyter was deceaſed, did ordaine the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: For the Canon of three Biſhops, and Metropolitans, added by the Nicene Councell, was not knowne yet. Nevertheleſſe it grew timely to be reſtrained to Biſhops, the performing I meane of the outward rite and ſigne; but onely by Canon, as Conſignation was alſo, for which there is as ancient teſtimonies as this, that it was appropriat to the Biſh. We grant therfore that antiquitie doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſpeak of the ordainer as one. In the Churches of Affrica one did not lay on hands, yet in ſome other churches the rite was by one adminiſtred. And it is to be noted by the way, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in ſome Canons is not oppoſed to the Coordaining of Presbyters, but to the number of <hi>Three,</hi> or many Biſhops required in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Biſhop. They might therfore by their canons be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe regularly and canonically the executing of it was com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is all that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> or <hi>Ieroms excepta ordinatione</hi> can prove. But theſe two concluſions we would ſee proved out of Scriptures and Fathers. Firſt, that ordination is an action of power of order, a power ſacramental, which a Presbyter hath not. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that by vertue of this power, the Biſhop doth ordaine, and not by Eccleſiaſticall right or commiſſion from the Church. Certainlie, the act of promoting a miniſter of the Church, is rather an act of iuriſdiction then order. As it belongeth to policie and government, to call new Magiſtrates, where they are wanting. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But a new ſpirituall officer may be inſtituted by a ſacrament. <hi>Anſw.</hi> If God would ſo have collated the grace of ſpirituall callings; but hee hath appointed no ſuch thing. The Apoſtles and 72. were not inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a ſacrament or impoſition of Chriſts hands. Now the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the grace was which was given, the more need of a ſacrament whereby it ſhould bee given. <hi>Obiect.</hi> They were extraordinarie, <hi>Anſw.</hi> They might have had ſome ambulatorie ſacrament for the time. Againe, impoſition of hands was uſed in giving extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary graces, Act. 8. Secondly, were it a ſacrament, it ſhould conferre the grace of office, as well as grace ſanctifying the perſon to uſe it holily. But we ſee that this it could not do As for <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> the Church did ſeparate them at the command of God, and lay hands on them, and pray for them, but they were alreadie before this, immediatlie choſen by God to the grace of their office. It could be nothing then but a a geſture accompanied with praier, ſeeking
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2189:36"/>
grace in their behalfe. For the ſacramentall collating of grace ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying all callings, we have in theſe two ſacraments of Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Thirdly, there are many kindes of impoſition of hands in the old and new teſtament, yet cannot it be proved, that it is any where a proper ſacrament. It is then a rite, a geſture, a ceremony, ſignifying a thing or perſon ſeparate, preſented to God, praied for to God. Thus Antiquitie did think of it, as a geſture of one, by praier to God, ſeeking a bleſſing on every one choſen to this or that place of miniſtery. So Eccleſiaſticallie it was uſed in baptiſing, in conſecrating, in reconciling penetents, as well as ordaining: but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver granted as a ſacrament in thoſe other caſes by grant of all. It is then a rite or geſture of one, praying, <hi>Tertul. de bapt.</hi> ſheweth this, ſaying, <hi>Manus imponitur per benedictionem advocans &amp; invitans ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſanctum. Ierom</hi> alſo <hi>contra Luciferanos, Non abnuo, hanc eſſe Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae conſuetudinem ut Epiſcopus manum impoſiturus excurrat ad invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationem ſpiritus ſancti. Amb. de dignit. ſacerdot. Sacerdos imponit ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicem dextram. Auguſt. Quid aliud eſt manus impoſitio quam oratio. &amp;c.</hi> The Greeke Churches haue ever given Orders by a forme of praier conceived with impoſition of hands. Hence it is, that they impoſed hands even on Deaconeſſes, where it could not bee otherwiſe conſidered then a deprecative geſture. Neither is it like the African Fathers ever thought it a ſacrament, which no other had vertue and power to miniſter, but the Biſhop. For then they would never haue admitted Preſbyters to uſe the ſame rite with them. For ſo they had ſuffered them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane a ſacrament, wherein they had no power to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. <hi>Obiect.</hi> If one ſay they did lay on hands with them, but the Biſhops impoſition was properlie <hi>Conſecrative</hi> and ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, theirs <hi>Deprecative</hi> onelie. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Beſides that this is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without foundation, how abſurd is it, that the verie ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame ſacramentall rite ſhould bee a ſacrament in one miniſters hand, and no ſacrament performed by another: Yea, when the Biſhop doth it to a Preſbyter, or Deacon, then a ſacrament; when to a Subdeacon, and other inferiour officers, then none, let any iudge. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did account no other of impoſition of hands, then a praier over a man, accompanied with that geſture. Secondlie, they doe not thinke that the Biſhop ordaineth by divine right, it being excepted to him as a miniſter of higher ſacramentall power: but that he onelie doth ordain <hi>quoad ſignum &amp; ritum extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecum,</hi> by the Churches commiſſion, though the right of ordaining bee in all the Preſbyterie alſo. As in a Colledge the ſocietie have right to chooſe a fellow, and to ordain him alſo, though the maſter doth alone lay on hands, and give admiſſion. Thus <hi>Ierom</hi> ſpeaketh of confirmation, that it was reſerved to the Biſhop for honour ſake,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2189:36"/>
rather then any neceſſitie of Gods law. Whence by analogie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, it followeth they think not ordination, or thoſe other Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall roialties to have been reſerved to him by divine right. Beſide there are more ancient proofes for Canonicall appropriating confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, then for this impoſition of hands. <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſpeaketh thus of <hi>Novatus,</hi> hee wanted thoſe things which hee ſhould have had after Baptiſme, according to the Canon, the ſealing of our Lord from a Biſhop, <hi>Euſeb. Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. So <hi>Cyprian</hi> to <hi>Iul.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe <hi>Ierom</hi> iudgeth this alſo to have been yeelded them for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſake. And wee know that in the Biſhops abſence, Preſbyters through the Eaſt did <hi>Conſignare,</hi> through Grecia, through Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. Neither would <hi>Gregorie</hi> the great haue allowed Preſbyters in the Greek Churches to have confirmed, had hee iudged it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then Canonicallie to belong to the Biſhops. That therefore which is not properly a ſacramentall action, and that which is not appropriate to a Biſhop further then Preſbyters have committed it to him, that cannot make him in higher degree of miniſterie then Preſbyters are.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in reconciling penitents, the Preſbyters did it in caſe of the Biſhops abſence: as is to bee gathered from the third Councell of Carthage, 32. And who thinkes bleſſing ſo appropriate to a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, that Preſbyters may not ſolemnlie bleſſe in the name of the Lord, though antiquitie reſerved this to him. Theſe therefore were kept to him, not as actes exceeding the Presbyters power of order, but for the ſuppoſed honor of him &amp; the Church.

Thoſe of his Clergie were under him; for hee might promote them, they might not goe from one Dioceſſe to another without him, not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell to the Citie, but by his leave.

                  <p>The propoſition of the firſt Syllogiſme it muſt bee thus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Thoſe who had power of iuriſdiction in themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concurrence of other Presbyters, as fellow judges, they were greater in maioritie of rule. Thus Bishops had not iuriſdiction. True it is, they were called governours and Princes of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, becauſe they were more eminent miniſters, though they had
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2189:37"/>
not Monarchicall power in Churches, but Conſull-like authoritie: and therefore when they affected this Monarchie, what ſayd <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, Noverint ſe ſacerdotes eſſe non dominos, noverint ſe non ad Principatum vocatos, ſed ad ſervitium totius Eccleſiae.</hi> Sic Origen in Eſa. hom. 7.</p>
                  <p>To the proofe of the Aſſumption. Wee deny that they had this directive power over all Preſbyters. Secondly, that they had it over any by humane conſtitution infallible. Presbyters were in great difference. Thoſe who are called <hi>proprij ſacerdotes, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctores, Seniores, Minorum Eccleſiarum praepoſiti,</hi> the Biſhop had not, nor challenged not that directive power over them, which hee did over thoſe who were numbred amongſt his Clerickes, who were helpes to him in the Liturgie, in Chappells and pariſhes which did depend on him as their proper teacher, though they could not ſo ordinarilie goe out to him. The firſt had power within their Churches, to teach, adminiſter, excommunicate, were counted brethren to the Biſhops, and called <hi>Epiſcopi,</hi> or <hi>Coepiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi> even of the Auncient: But the Presbyters, which were part of their Clergie, they had this directiue power over them, the Canons Eccleſiaſticall allowing the ſame. But I take theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have been but a corruption of governing presbyters, who came to bee made a humane miniſtery, 1. by having ſingular actes permitted. 2. by being conſecrate to this, &amp; ſo doing <hi>ex officio,</hi> what they were imploied in by the Biſhop. But ſure theſe are but helps to liturgie, according to the Canons. Preaching did not agree to them further then it could be delegated or permitted. Finally, we read, that by law it was permitted them: that it was taken away from them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the Biſhops: that it was ſtinted and limited ſometime as to the opening of the Lords praier, the Creed and 10 commandements: as it is plain to him that is any thing converſant in the ancient. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, let us account them as miniſters of the word, given by God to his church: then I ſay, they could not have any direction, but ſuch as the Apoſtles had amongſt Evangeliſts: and this power is given to the Biſhops onelie by canon ſwerving from the firſt ordinance of Chriſt: for it maketh a miniſter of the word become as a cypher, without power of his conſecration, as <hi>Ierom</hi> ſpeaketh, being ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by <hi>Bilſon</hi> himſelf. Theſe decrees were as juſtifiable, as that which forbiddeth any to baptiſe, who hath not gotten chriſme from the Biſhop <hi>Con. Carth.</hi> 4. <hi>ca.</hi> 36. unleſſe the phraſes doe note onelie a precedence of order in the Biſhop aboue presbyters, requiring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and aſſent, as of a fellow and chiefe member, not otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>To the proof of the ſecond part of the former aſſumption, 1. we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie this majoritie of corrective power to have been in the Apoſtles themſelves: they had only a miniſtry executiue inflicting that which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2189:38"/>
Chriſts corrective power impoſed. Secondly, we deny that this mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall power of cenſuring was ſingularly exerciſed by any Apoſtle or Evangliſt, where Churches were conſtituted. Neither is the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to one aboue others, an argument that he had the power to doe all alone without concurrence of others. To that of <hi>Cyprian</hi> againſt <hi>Rogatian,</hi> we deny that <hi>Cyprian</hi> meaneth he would haue done it alone, or that he and his Presbyterie could have done it without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Biſhops neighbouring: but that he might in regular manner have been bold to have done it, becauſe he might be ſure, <hi>quod nos collegae tui omnes id r<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tum haberemut. Cyprian</hi> was of iudgement, that he himſelf might do nothing without the conſent of his Presbyters, unleſſe he ſhould violate his dutie, by running a courſe which ſtood not with the honour of his brethren. It was not modeſtie in him; but due obſervancie, ſuch as he did owe unto his brethren. Neither did <hi>Cyprian</hi> ever ordinarilie any thing alone. He received ſome, the people and the brethren contradicting, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ep.</hi> 3. but not till he had perſwaded them, and brought them to be willing. <hi>Thou ſeeſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what pains I have to perſwade the brethren to patience.</hi> So againe, <hi>I hardly perſwade the people, yea even wring it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, that ſuch ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi> Neither did he take upon him to ordaine Presbyters alone: but propounded, made requeſt for them, confeſſing, that further then God did extraordinarilie prevent both him and them, they had the right of ſuffrage, no leſſe then himſelfe, as by theſe epiſtles may appeare, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>ep.</hi> 20. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>ep.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>ep.</hi> 10. <hi>Ierom</hi> (though grandiloquent ſometimes) did never thinke a Biſhop could lawfully without his Presbyteries concurrence, excommunicate. If he were as <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet hee would haue theſe as the ſeventie. Againe, <hi>Ierom</hi> doth write expreſlie of all in generall, <hi>Et nos ſenatum babemus, coetum Preſbyterorum, ſine quorum conſilio nihil agi à quoquam licet, ſicut Romani habuerun: ſenatum cujus conſilio cuncta gerebantur. Epiphanius</hi> ſaith, Biſhops governed Preſbyters: but it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that therfore they did it alone without concurrence of their com-Preſbyters. As for the fixed Preſbyters, the proofes are more unſufficient. The Biſhop ſupplyed them, therefore they were under him. For colleges ſupply Churches, yet haue they no juriſdiction over them. Secondly, the canons did provide <hi>ne plebi invitae Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obtruderetur.</hi> Thirdly, we diſtinguiſh majoritie of rule from ſome juriſdiction. We grant the Biſhop had ſuch a juriſdiction as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Church, ſo farre as it was in ſocietie with others, ſuch as an Arch-biſhop hath over a Province: but this did ſtand with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors power of juriſdiction within his own Church. Fourthly, though they had power by his miniſteriall interpoſition, yet this doth not proue them dependant on him. For Biſhops haue their power from others ordaining them, to whom notwithſtanding they are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2189:38"/>
in their Churches. In caſe of delinquencie they were ſubject to the Biſhop with the Preſbyterie, yet ſo that they could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt till conſent of many other Biſhops did ratifie the ſentence. Thus in <hi>Cyprians</hi> judgement, Biſhops themſelves delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, turning wolves, as <hi>Samoſatenus, Liberius,</hi> &amp;c. are ſubiect to their Churches &amp; Presbyters, to be depoſed and relinquiſhed by them. As for thoſe that were part of his Clerks, it is true, they were in greater meaſure ſubject to him, abſolutely in a manner for their direction: but for his corrective power hee could not without conſent of his Presbyters and fellow Biſhops, do any thing. The Biſhop indeed is onely named many times: but it is a common Synecdoche, familiar to the fathers, who put the primarie member of the Church for the repreſentative Church, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, <hi>Petrum propter Apoſtola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ſimplicitatem figuram Eccleſiae geſſiſſe.</hi> See concil. Sardicen. c. 17. conc. Carth. 4. c. 2.3. Tol. 4. c. 4. Socr. l. 1. 3. Soz. l. 1. c. 14. As for ſuch examples as <hi>Alexanders,</hi> it is ſtrange that any will bring it, when hee did it not without a Synod of many Biſhops, yea without his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, as ſitting in judgement with him. <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> fact fact is not to be iuſtified: for it was altogether irregular, ſavouring of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous nature to which is he was inclined, though in regard of his end, and unworthineſſe of his Presbyters, it may be excuſed, yet it is not to be imitated. As for thoſe headleſſe Clerkes, it maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the Biſhops maioritie of rule over all Churches and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in them. For firſt, it ſeemeth to be ſpoken of thoſe that lived under the conduct of the Biſhop, a collegiat life together, <hi>Eodem refectorio &amp; dormitorio utebantur, &amp; Canonicè viventes ab Epiſcopo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruebantur.</hi> Now when all ſuch Clerkes did live then as members of a Colledge under a maiſter, it is no wonder if they bee called head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, who did belong to no Biſhop. Secondly, ſay it were alike of all Presbyters, which will never be proved (for all Preſbyters in the Dioceſſe were not belonging to the Biſhops Clerks) ſay it were, yee will it not follow, that thoſe who were under ſome, were ſubject to his authoritie of rule. For there is a head in regard of preſidencie of order, as well as of power. Biſhops were to finde out by Canon the chiefe Biſhop of their province, and to aſſociate themſelves with him. So Biſhops doe now live ranged under their Archbiſhops as heads. Prieſts therefore as well as Clerkes, did live under ſome iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Biſhops: but ſuch as did permit them coercive power in their owne Churches, ſuch as made the Biſhop a head in regard of dignitie, and not of any power, vvhereby he might ſway all at his pleaſure. Thirdlie, if the Biſhops degenerate to challenge Monarchie or tyrannie, it is better bee without ſuch heads then to have them: as we are more happie in being withdrawen from the headſhip of the Biſhop of Rome, then if he ſtill were head over us.

To the laſt inſinuation, proving that Biſhops had the government of thoſe Churches which presbyters had, becauſe neither preſbyters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone had it, nor with aſſiſtents.

When the Apoſtles planted a Biſhop and Deacon onely, how did this Biſhop excommunicate?

                  <p>To the propoſition, we denie that it muſt needs be preſently true, the contrarie wherof is generallie condemned for hereſie. As the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative catholick church may propound an errour, ſo ſhe may condemne a particular truth, and yet remain a catholick church. To the aſſumption we deny that the Church condemned in <hi>Aerius</hi> every deniall of ſuperioritie, but that onely which <hi>Aerius</hi> run into. Now his opinion I take to have been this. 1. He did with <hi>Ierom</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſuperioritie of anie kind as due by Chriſts ordinance: for this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion was never counted hereſie, it was <hi>Ieroms</hi> plainlie. 2. He did not denie the fact, that Biſhops were ſuperiour in their actuall admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; he could not be ſo mad. If he had all that a Biſhop had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallie, how could he have affected to be a Biſhop, as a further ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? Denial of ſuperioritie, ſuch as conſiſteth in a further power of order then a Presbyter hath, and in a kinglie monarchical majoritie of rule, this deniall is not here condemned: for all the fathers may be broughs as witneſſes againſt this ſuperioritie in the Church. What then was condemned in him? A denial of all ſuperioritie in one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter before another, though it were but of honor and dignitie: and ſecondlie the denying of this in ſchiſmaticall manner, ſo as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake communion with the Church wherin it is. For in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he is to be conceived as appoſing practicallie the difference of honour &amp; dignitie which was in the Church by Eccleſiaſtical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. What is this to us? Denial of ſuperioritie ia regard of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor &amp; dignitie, joined with ſchiſme, was condemned: Ergo, deniall of ſuperioritie in power of order and kinglie majoritie of rule, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the bond of loue was condemned.</p>

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:2189:39"/>The aſſumption therefore if it aſſume not of this laſt deniall, then can it not conclude againſt us. Ergo, it is a truth that ſome Miniſters may be aboue otherſome, in order, honor, and dignity. But they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not by order ſuch an order onely as is diſtinct, becauſe ſome degree of dignitie is appropriate to it, which is not to other. Though this argument therefore touch us not, yet to ſpeake a little further about it, this opinion of <hi>Aerius</hi> is not to be handled too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely: neither our authors, D. <hi>Whitakerus,</hi> D. <hi>Reinolds, Danaeus,</hi> to be blamed, who doe in ſome ſort excuſe him. For Biſhops were grown ſuch that many good perſons were offended at them, as the <hi>Audiani.</hi> Yea, it was ſo ordinarie, that <hi>Ierome</hi> diſtinguiſheth ſchiſme from hereſie, becauſe the one conteined aſſertions againſt the faith, the other ſevered from the Church by reaſon of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting from Biſhops. See him on <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. Neither is it plain that he was an Arrian. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reporteth it, but no other, though writing of this ſubject and ſtorie of theſe time. Sure it is, <hi>Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> was a ſtrong Arian, whom <hi>Aerius</hi> did oppoſe. Neither is it ſtrange for Biſhops to faſten on thoſe which diſſent from them in this point of their freehold, any thing whereof there is but ungroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuſpicion. Are not we traduced as Donatiſts, Anabaptiſts, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes? As for his opinion, they thought it rather ſchiſmatical, then hereticall: &amp; therfore happily called it hereſie, becauſe it included er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in their underſtanding, which with ſchiſmaticall pertinacie was made hereſie. Neither is it likely that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doth otherwiſe count it hereſie, nor <hi>Auſtin</hi> following him. For though <hi>Auſtine</hi> was aged, yet he was ſo humble, that hee ſaith, <hi>Auguſtinus ſenex à puero nondum anniculo paratus ſum edoceri.</hi> Neither was it prejudice to his worth for to follow men more ancient then himſelfe, who in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood ſhould know this matter alſo better. As for his calling it hereſie, it is certaine he would not haue this in rigour ſtreined. For he doth proteſt (in his preface unto that book of hereſies) that none to his thought, can in a regular definition comprehend what that is which maketh this or that to be hereſie. Though therefore he doubted not of this, that <hi>Aerius</hi> was in errour, ſuch as all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes ſhould decline: yet it doth not argue that he thought this errour in rigour and formall propriety, to haue been hereſie.

But they firſt placed Preſbyters, feeding
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2189:40"/>
with the Word and governing: and to thoſe in their laſt departings they commended the Churches. Ergo. The aſſumption is denied: they did not place them, as the chiefe ordinary Paſtors in thoſe Churches, but placed them to teach and governe, <hi>in fore interno;</hi> with a reference of ſubordination to a more eminent Paſtor, which when now they were growen to a juſt multitude ſhould be given to them. The Apoſtles had all power of order and juriſdiction: they gaue to Preſbyters power of order, power to teach, miniſter ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo gather together a great number of thoſe who were yet to be converted; but kept the coerciue power in their own hands, meaning, when now by the Preſbyters labour, the Churches were grown to a greater multitude, meaning (I ſay) then to ſet over them ſome more eminent Paſtors, Apoſtolicall men, to whom they would commit the power of government, that ſo they might rule over both the Preſbyters and their Churches; and to theſe with their ſucceſſours, not to the Preſbyters, were the Churches recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. All which is an audacious fiction, without any warrant of Scripture, or ſhew of good reaſon. For it is confeſſed, that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were placed at the firſt conſtitution, as the Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Churches. Now if the Apoſtles had done this with reference to a further and more eminent Paſtor and Governour they would haue intimated ſomewhere this their intention: but this they doe not; yea, the contrary purpoſe is by them declared. For <hi>Peter</hi> ſo biddeth his Preſbyters feed their flocks, as that he doth inſinuate them ſubject to no other but Chriſt, the Arch-ſhepheard of them all. Againe, the Apoſtles could not make the Preſbyters Paſtors without power of government. There may be governours without paſtorall power; but not a Paſtor without power of governing. For the power of the <hi>Pedum,</hi> or ſhepheards ſtaffe, doth intrinſecally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Paſtorall office. What likelyhood is there, that thoſe who were ſet as parents to beget children ſhould not be truſted with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the rod wherewith children now begotten are to be nurtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and kept in awe beſeeming them? If it be ſaid, every one fit for the office of a Teacher, was not fit for a Governour. I anſwer, hee that is fit to be a Paſtor teaching and governing <hi>in foro interno,</hi> is much more fit to be a Governour externally: hee vvho is fit for the greater is fit for the leſſer. It vvas a greater and more Apoſtolicall vvorke to labour converſion, and bring the Churches a handfull in the planting (as ſome thinke) to become numberſome in people, then it is to govern them being converted. And it is abſurd to think that thoſe who were fit to gather a Church, and bring it to fulneſſe from ſmall beginnings, ſhould not be fit to governe it, but ſtand in need to haue ſome one ſent, who might rule them and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches they had collected. Secondly, theſe Preſbyters vvere (as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themſelues

Finally, by the twentie of the Acts, and the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> ch. 5. it is plaine, they doe in their laſt farewels commit the Churches unto the Preſbyters, not ſuggeſting any thing of a further Paſtor to bee ſent, vvho ſhould ſupply their roomes: vvhich yet they would not haue forgotten, being a thing of ſo great conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, had it been intended by them.</p>

Secondly, there is nothing found belonging to the power of the keyes <hi>in foro externo,</hi> but the Scripture doth aſcribe it to them, power of ſuffrage in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. power of excommunication, which is manifeſt to haue been in the Church of Corinth when it had no Biſhop, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ordination, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. If any ſay, that this their power was but by commiſſion in them, and that they were ſubordinate to the Apoſtles in exerciſe of it, being to reteine it onely untill ſuch time as more eminent Paſtors ſhould be given: I anſwer, all this is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>gratis,</hi> without any foundation, and therefore no more eaſily vouched then rejected. The Presbyters ſo had this power, that they did commit it to the Biſhops, as we ſhall ſhew after: and therefore it muſt haue been in them, not by extraordinary commiſſion, but by ordinarie office. Secondly, they were ſubject in exerciſe to none but Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt, who onely had out of authoritie truſted them with it. If the Apoſtles and they did concurre in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one and the ſame thing, they did it as inferiour to the Apoſtles, and ſervants of a lower order, not with any ſubjection to them, as heads of derivation, ſerving Chriſt their onely Lord, no leſſe immediately then the Apoſtles themſelues.</p>

               <p>That which is found in all other orders of Miniſters inſtituted by Chriſt, may be preſumed likewiſe in the order of Paſtors and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: but in all other orders, there were none that had ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of preheminence and majority of power aboue other. No A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, Prophet, Euangeliſt had this rule one over another. If the propoſition bee denyed, upon ſuppoſall of a different rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe that though paritie in a few extraordinarie Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters might bee admitted without diſorder, yet in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ordinarie Miniſters, it could not but breed ſchiſme and confuſion, and therfore as the order of Prieſthood was divided into
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2189:41"/>
a high Prieſt, and other ſecondary ones, ſo is it fit that the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the new Teſtament ſhould be divided, ſome being in the firſt, and ſome in the ſecond ranke. To this I anſwer, the paritie is the more dangerous, by how much the places are ſupereminent. Secondly, though Paſtors ſhould be equall, yet this would not bring parity into the Miniſters of the Church, ſome whereof ſhould be in degree inferiour to other, the governing Elders to the Paſtors, and the Deacons to them. Thirdly, if every Church being an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall body, ſhould haue governours every way equall, there were no feare of confuſion, ſeeing Ariſtocracie, eſpecially where God ordaineth it, is a forme of government ſufficient to preſerue order. But every Church might then doe what ever it would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelfe. Not ſo neither; for it is ſubject to the cenſure of other Churches ſynodically aſſembled, and to the civill Magiſtrate, who in caſe of delinquencie, hath directiue and correctiue power over it. Parity doth not ſo much indanger the Church by ſchiſme, as imparity doth by tyrannie ſubject it. As for the diſtinction of Prieſts, we grant it; but as man could not haue made that diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had not God ordained it in time of the old Teſtament, no more can we under the new. Howbeit, that diſtinction of Prieſts did bring in no ſuch difference in order and majority of rule, as our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops now challenge.</p>

               <p>If ſome be inferiour unto otherſome in degree of power, it muſt be in regard of their power to teach, or their power to govern, or in the application of this power to their perſons, or in regard of the people whom they teach and governe, or finally, in regard the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their power is at the direction of another. But no Paſtor or Teacher dependeth on any other but Chriſt for any of theſe. Ergo. The propoſition ſtandeth on a ſufficient enumeration: the aſſumption may be proved in the ſeverall parts of it. The former branch is thus cleared. Firſt, the power we haue, is the ſame eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially with theirs; yea, every way the ſame. Secondly, wee haue it as immediately from Chriſt as they. I ſhew them both thus: The power of order is the power which inableth us to preach and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole counſell of God, and to miniſter all Sacraments ſealing Gods covenant. Now unleſſe we will with the Papiſts, ſay that preaching is no neceſſary <hi>annexum</hi> to the Preſbyters office, or that his power is a rudimentall limited power, as to open the creed, Lords prayer, and commandements onely, or that he hath not the full power ſacramentall, there being other ſacraments of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confirmation which we may not miniſter, all which are groſſe, we muſt yeeld their power of order to be the ſame. Yea, were theſe ſacraments properly, they are both grounded in the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2189:41"/>
power a Preſbyter hath: Ordination in <hi>doe this in remembrance of me</hi>: confirmation in power to baptize. The power being the ſame, it is happily in one immediately, and in the other by derivation from him. Nothing leſſe. All grant that Chriſt doth immediately giue it, even as the inward grace of every Sacrament commeth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally from him The Church, did ſhe giue this power, might make the ſacrament and preaching which one doth in order, no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, no preaching. The Pope doth not (if we follow the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tenent) callenge ſo much as to giue the power of order to any Biſhop or Prieſt whatſoever. If you ſay, the Preſbyter is ordained by the Biſhop, that is nothing: ſo is the Biſhop by other Biſhops, from whom notwithſtanding he receiveth not this power. We will take this as granted of all: though the truth is, all doe not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it from right grounds. But it will be ſaid, the Preſbyter is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in juriſdiction, and can haue none but what is derived to him from the Biſhop, who hath the fulneſſe of it within his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Church. But this is falſe, and grounded on many falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions. As firſt, that Miniſters of the Word are not properly and fully Paſtors; for to make a Paſtor, and giue him no help againſt the Wolfe, is to furniſh him forth imperfectly. Secondly, it preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the power of juriſdiction to be given originally and fontally to one perſon of the Church, and ſo to others, whereas Chriſt hath committed it <hi>originaliter</hi> &amp; <hi>exercitative</hi> to the repreſentatiue Church, that they might Ariſtocratically adminiſter it. Thirdly, this preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the plenitude of regiment to be in the Biſhop, and from him to be derived to other: which maketh him a head of virtuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, that in his Church, which the Pope doth challenge in regard of all Biſhops. For his headſhip and ſpirituall ſoveraigntie ſtandeth according to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this, that the government of all <hi>in fore externo,</hi> is committed to him. Not to mention, how Biſhops, while they were Biſhops gloried of their chaire and teaching, as the ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their garland, preferring it farre before government, but when they were fallen from their ſpirituall felicitie, and infected with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſmoke, then they recommended the labour of teaching to the Preſbyters, then their juriſdiction and conſiſtorie did carie all the credite, everie office in the Church being counted a dignitie, as it had more or leſſe juriſdiction annexed; as thoſe are more or leſſe honourable in the Common-wealth, which haue civill authoritie in leſſe or greater meaſure conjoyned. The truth is, it cannot be ſhewed that God ever made Paſtor without this juriſdiction; for whether it do agree to men as they are Paſtors, or as they are Prelats in the Church, it cannot be avoided but that the Paſtor ſhould haue it, becauſe though everie <hi>Praeſul</hi> or <hi>Praelatus,</hi> be not a Paſtor, yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Paſtor is <hi>Praelatus,</hi> in order to that Church where he is the proper
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2189:42"/>
and ordinarie Paſtor. Yea, when cenſure is the moſt ſharp ſpirituall medicine, it were ill with everie Church, if he who is reſident alwaies among them as their ſpirituall Phiſition, ſhould not haue power in adminiſtring it. Thirdly, I ſay, no Miniſter hath majoritie of power in applying the power of order or juriſdiction to this or that perſon. In the application there is a Miniſterie of the Church interpoſed: but ſo that Chriſt onely is the cauſe with power, not onely why Preſbyters are in the Church, but why <hi>Thomas</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> is choſen to and beſtowed on this or that place. A Maiſter onely doth out of power take everie ſervant into his houſe: ſo God in his. God did thoſe <hi>Aarons</hi> ſonns with the Levites, and Chriſt the 70, not medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately leaving it to the arbitrement of any to ſet out thoſe that ſhould ſtand before him. God doth ever onely in regard of authoritie, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie all power Eccleſiaſticall to everie particular perſon, his ſole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie doth it, though ſometime as in ordinarie callings, the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie of others doth concurre. The Church is in ſetting out, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining this or that man, as the Colledge is in chooſing, when ſhee taketh the man whom the ſtatute of her founder doth moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly deſcribe, or where the Kings mandate doth ſtrictly injoyne, it would otherwiſe bring an imperiall power into the Church. For though many Kings cannot hinder but that there ſhall be ſuch and ſuch officers, and places of governement as are in their Kingdom, yet while they are free at their pleaſure to depute this or that man to the places vacant, they haue a Kingly juriſdiction in them. Briefly, God doth ever apply the power Eccleſiaſticall unto the perſon: ſometime alone by himſelfe, as in the Apoſtles, and then he doth it <hi>tam immediatione ſuppoſiti quam virtutis:</hi> ſometime the miniſterie of man concurring extraordinarily, as when God extraordinarilie directeth a perſon to goe and call one to this or that place, as he did <hi>Samuel</hi> to annoint <hi>Saul.</hi> Or elſe ordinarily, when God doth by his Writ and Spirit, guide men to take any to this or that place in his Church, which he doth partly by his written ſtatutes, and partly by his Spirit: and thus he doth make the application onely <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datione virtutis,</hi> not <hi>ſuppoſiti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But yet Biſhops haue the Churches, &amp; the care of them wholly committed to them; though therfore Miniſters haue equall power to them, yet they cannot without their leaue haue any place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Churches, and therefore are inferiour, in as much as the people with whom they exerciſe their power of order and juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are aſſigned to them by the Biſhop the proper Paſtor of them. This is an errour likewiſe: For God doth make no Miniſter to whom hee doth not aſſigne a flock which hee may attend. God calleth Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, not to a facultie of honour, which doth qualifie them with power to miniſteriall actions, if any giue them perſons among whom
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2189:42"/>
they may exerciſe their power received, as the Emperours did make <hi>Chartularios judices,</hi> who had a power to judge cauſes if any would ſubject himſelfe to them. Or as the Count Palatine hath ordinarie Iudges, who are <hi>habitu tantum judices,</hi> having none under them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom they may exerciſe juriſdiction. Or as the univerſity giveth the degree of a Doctor in Phyſick, without any patients a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom hee may practiſe. But Gods Miniſterie is the calling of a man to an actuall adminiſtration, <hi>Goe teach</hi>: and the power of order is nothing by the way, but a relatiue reſpect, founded in this, that I am called to ſuch an actuall adminiſtration. Now there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an act commanded, without the ſubject about which it is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied: otherwiſe, God ſhould giue them a facultie of feeding, and leaue them depending on others for ſheep to feed; God ſhould make them but remote potentiall Miniſters, and the Biſhop actuall. Thirdly, the Holy Ghoſt is ſaid to haue ſet the Preſbyters over their flock. A man taking a ſteward, or other ſervant into his houſe, doth giue him a power of doing ſomething to his familie; and never thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of taking ſervants, further then the neceſſitie of his houſhold doth require: ſo is it with God in his Church, which is his houſe: fore the exigency of his people ſo require, he doth not cal any to the function of Miniſterie. Again, this is enough to ground the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which Antichriſt aſſumeth: For ſome make his ſoveraignetie to ſtand onely in this, not that he giveth order or power of juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that he giveth to all Paſtors &amp; Biſhops the moytie of ſheep, on whom this their power is exerciſed, Chriſt having given him the care of all his ſheep, <hi>feed my ſheep.</hi> ſo <hi>Vaſquez.</hi> Thus if a Biſhop challenge all the ſheep in a Dioceſan flock to be his, &amp; that he hath power to aſſigne the ſeverall flocks under him, he doth uſurp an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian authoritie. Finally, if the Churches be the Biſhops through the Dioceſſe, Miniſters then are under them in their Churches, but as a curate is, whom a Parſon giveth leaue to help within his Church. Yea, they ſhould looſe their right in their Churches, when the Biſhop dyeth, as a Curate doth when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this or that Church, whom he aſſiſted, is once departed. To conclude, they are not dependant (one Miniſter I meane on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother) in the exerciſe and uſe of their calling. A ſervant that hath any place, doth know from his Maiſter what belongeth to it. The Prieſts and Levites had ſet downe what belonged to their places, as well as the high Prieſt what belonged to his. Againe, God hath deſcribed the Preſbyters office, as amply as any other. A Legate dependeth on none for inſtructions, but on him that ſendeth him; now everie Miniſter is an Embaſſadour of Chriſt. By their reaſon a Miniſter ſhould be accountant to man for what he did in his Miniſterie, if his exerciſing of it did depend on man. Then alſo
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2189:43"/>
ſhould miniſters mediatly only ſerue God, in as much as they haue done this or that, to which the Biſhop did direct them. Moreover, ſhould the Biſhop bid him not preach at all, preach rarely, teach onely ſuch and ſuch things, or come and liue from his charge, he ſhould not ſin in obeying him. But man cannot limit that power of miniſterie which he cannot giue. It is not with Gods ſervants in his Church, as with civill ſervants in the Common-wealth: for here ſome ſervants are aboue others whom they command as they will, ſuch as are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>ſervi ordinarii</hi> or <hi>praepoſiti,</hi> ſome are under others to doe this or that commanded by them, commonly called <hi>ſervi vicarii</hi>: but in the Church all ſervants ſerue their Maiſter Chriſt, neither having any that they can command, nor being under any but Chriſt ſo as to be commanded by them. But it may be objected, that God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained ſome to be helps and aſſiſtants to otherſome It is ſayd that God hath ordained powers, helps, governours, 1. Cor. 12.8. and were not the Euangeliſts aſſiſtants to the Apoſtles, doing that to which they directed them? To this I anſwer, that the helps God hath put in his Church reſpect the calling of Deacons, and ſuch as miniſtred to the infirme ones: As for Euangeliſts, they were companions and aſſiſtants to the Apoſtles, but it was in order to the work of God in their hands, which they were to ſerue, not in order to their perſons, as if they had been ſubjected to them in any ſervile inferioritie. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue how <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of them 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Titus</hi> was his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and helper towards them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and helper in his work, and fellow ſouldier, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> was his coadjutor in the Goſpell of Chriſt, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Marke</hi> was helpefull in the Miniſterie. The truth is, this was <hi>ſervitus non perſonalis ſed realis,</hi> the Euangeliſts did ſerue the work the Apoſtles had in hand, without being ſervants to their perſons. When bricke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers worke, ſome mixe lime, and make mortar, ſome beare up tile and mortar, ſome ſit on the houſe and there lay that which is brought them. Theſe are all fellow ſervants, yet the one doth ſerve to ſet forward the work of the other. But were they not left to the direction of the Apoſtles; wholly in exerciſe of their calling? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, as Chriſt gaue ſome to be Euangeliſts, ſo he made them know from himſelfe what belonged to their office, and what was the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration to which he called them. Hee did not therefore wholly leaue them to the direction of any. There is a double direction, one <hi>poteſtativa,</hi> which is made from majoritie of rule <hi>ex</hi>

Which though commonly <hi>Paul</hi> uſed, yet not ſo univerſally but that they went ſometime of their owne accords

But this is it which maketh Antichriſt, he doth take upon him to bee head of the whole Church from whom is derived this power of external government: and the Biſhop doth no leſſe in his Dioceſan Church, that which he uſurpeth differing in degree onely and extenſion, not in kind from that which the Pope arrogateth. If it bee ſaid that his power is Antichriſtian, becauſe it is univerſall: it is not ſo. For were the power lawfull, the univerſalitie could not make it Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian. The Apoſtles had an univerſalitie of authoritie, yet no Antichriſts, becauſe it did not make them heads, deriving to others from their fulneſſe: it was not prince-like majoritie of power, but ſteward like and miniſteriall onely.

This miniſteriall power is no ſupernaturall vertue or qualitie inherent in the foule: but a relative reſpect founded on this, that I am called by God to this or that actuall admimniſtration in his Church. For it is not a power ſimply, whereby a man is made able to doe ſome ſupernaturall act, which he could not before in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manner performe: but it is reſpectively ſayd a power, in as much as it doth inable him to doe thoſe acts in the Church of God law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and <hi>ex officio,</hi> vvith vvhich before hee might not intermedle. The power of a Deacon, Paſtor, Evangeliſt, Apoſtle, belong to one predicament in regard of that which is the genus or common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them: the power of the Church cannot be other. Naturall and civill power doth vvith vertue and efficacie reach thoſe effects and ends to vvhich they are deſigned: becauſe they are proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them, and exceed not their activitie: but Eccleſiaſtical power cannot thus concurre to the end and effects for which it is ordained: becauſe they are ſuch as the omnipotencie of God onely can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, as the converting or creating grace in the heart of a ſinner, to vvhich no ſupernaturall vertue in man can by any reall, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentarie, efficacie, conduce any thing.</p>

                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 3. God hath not given miniſteriall power to any, vvhich himſelfe is not perſonally to diſcharge, nor in further plenitude then that by himſelfe it may be performed. The reaſon is, becauſe God cannot give one the charge of doing more then a mans proper induſtry can atchieve, but hee muſt withall put it in a mans power to take others, and to impart with them power of tea<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hing and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, ſo farre as may ſupply that defect which is in his ſtrength to performe it alone. Hee that will have the end, will have that vvithout vvhich the end cannot be attained. If God vvould have any one an univerſall paſtor to all the Churches of the vvorld, hee muſt needs allow him power to ſubſtitute Paſtors here and there, deriving unto them power both to teach and governe, ſo far as may ſupply his abſence in the Paſtorall care. If I will have one keep my flocks vvhich goe in 20 ſheep-gates, if I commit them them to one, I muſt needs together give him leave to aſſume unto himſelfe ſuch as may be under-ſheepheards to him. Thus if God giue a Biſhop the plenitude of Paſtorall care and government over all the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionall Churches through a Dioceſſe, hee muſt needs together al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv him this povver, of being a head of internall influence; even a head virtually communicating vvith others part of paſtorall power, vvhether teaching or government. Thus ſhould none but Biſhops be <hi>ex officio</hi> ſervants in Paſtorall cure to God: all others ſhould bee
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2189:45"/>
immediatly and formally ſervants to the Biſhop, and doe everie thing in the name of the Biſhop, being immediatly onely and in a remote ſenſe the ſervants of God: as in the former compariſon of one ſervant receiving from his maſter the care of all the flockes, he is the maſters ſervant to vvhom the maſter committeth the truſt, from vvhom he onely looketh to ſee it performed: but thoſe whom this ſheepheard taketh to himſelfe for his aide, they come under his dominion, and are ſervants to him. If it be ſayd, that God doth not thus make the Biſhop Paſtor, but that he will likewiſe that there be pariſh Paſtors under him, and helpes of government. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, if God will have them, then either after his own deſignement, or elſe leaving it to the Biſhops arbitrement: if hee leave it to the Biſhops arbitrement, then the objection before is in force, God will looke for the cure from him onely, he ſhall take according to his judgement, ſuch as may help him. If God will have them after his own deſignment, then he giveth the Biſhop no more Paſtorall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer then he can diſcharge himſelfe, others having their right in all the Biſhop cannot execute, as well as the Biſhop, and as immediatly from Chriſt. Some write, as if the Apoſtles had the plenitude of all Paſtorall power, that from them it might be derived to the Church, it being ſeen through nature, that inferiour things receive iufluence from the ſuperiour. But they miſconceive the matter; they had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a power to ſerve the Church with the perſonall ſervice of their Apoſtleſhip. The Paſtorall power of Evangeliſts, or of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Paſtors and teachers, they never had. For as Chriſt gave the one order, ſo the two other alſo, for the gathering of the Saints, and exae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying of the body of Chriſt: and no perſon in any ranke had any power to do this or that in the Church further then himſelfe might performe in perſon The ſteward in a houſe hath ful power of a ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but not the power of all other officers, as Clark of the kitchin, Butler, Chamberlaine, &amp;c. So in theſe divers orders of ſervants in Gods houſe, his Church If the Apoſtles had had the fulneſſe of Paſtorall cure, they ſhould then have ordained others Evangeliſts, and Paſtors not onely by miniſteriall mediation of their perſons calling them, but alſo by mediation of vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 4. One miniſteriall power may bee in degree of dignitie aboue another. For the power of one may be about more noble acts then the power of another, or in the ſame kind, the power of one may be more extended, and the power of another more contracted. Thus the Deacons had for the object of their power and care, not ſo excellent a thing as that of Paſtors, Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles. Thus the power of ordinarie Paſtors was not ſo univerſall as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, even as in the orders of ſervants domeſticall, ſome are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied about leſſer, ſome about greater and more honorable ſubjects.</p>

                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 5. No order of Miniſters or ſervants can have majoritie of directive and corrective power over thoſe who are in inferiour order of miniſterie and ſervice. The reaſon is, becauſe this exceedeth the bounds of miniſteriall power, and is a participation of that deſpoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power which is appropriate to the maſter of the familie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 6. Servants in one degree may have power to ſignifie their maſters direction, and to execute miniſterially what their maſter out of his corrective power inflicteth on their fellow ſervants in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degrees. Thus Paſtors ſignifie Gods will to governing Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons, what he would have them to doe in their places. Thus the Apoſtles might informe all orders under them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 7. This power miniſteriall tending to execute the pleaſure of Chriſts corrective power, was committed to ſome in extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degrees, perſonally and ſingularly, and might be ſo in ſome caſes exerciſed by them. I mean ſingularitie without concurrence of any others. This without doubt was in the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts: and it was needfull it ſhould bee ſo: firſt, becauſe it might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovefull there to excommunicate where as yet Churches were not riſen to their perfect frame: ſecondly, becauſe there might be ſome perſons not ſetled as fixed dwellers in any Church, whom yet to be caſt forth was very behovefull. Againe, ſome Evangeliſts might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre cenſure, as <hi>Demas,</hi> in ſuch ſort as no ordinary Churches power could reach to them.</p>

That ordinarily this power is not given to any one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly by himſelfe to exerciſe the ſame, but with the companie of others conſtituting a repreſentative Church: which is the poynt next to bee ſhewed. Yea where Churches were conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Apoſtles did not offer to exerciſe their power, without the miniſteriall concurrence of the Churches, as in the ſtorie of the Corinthians is manifeſt.</p>

            <head>THE THIRD QVESTION, Whether Chriſt did immediatly commit ordinarie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer Eccleſiaſticall, and the exerciſe of it, to any one ſingular perſon, or to a vnited multitude of Presbyters.</head>
            <p>THough this queſtion is ſo coincident with the former, that the grounds hath in a ſort been diſcuſſed: yet for ſome new conſiderations which may bee ſuper-added, wee will briefly handle it in the Method premiſed.</p>

Ergo, to one who is in effect as the church, having all the authority of it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if one perſon may be repreſentativly a Church, when juriſdiction is promiſed; then one perſon may be repreſentatiuly a church when juriſdiction and power of exerciſing is committed.

Ergo. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to <hi>Iubaia</hi> ſayth, that the Biſhop is in the Church, and the Church ſo in the Biſhop, that they cannot bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Finally, as the kingdome of England may bee put for the King in whom is all the power of the kingdome: So the Church for the chiefe governour in whom is the power of it.</p>

               <p>That which the Churches had not given them when they were conſtituted, that was not promiſed to them as their immediat right.

For then the Apoſtles would not have withheld it from theſe. But they did. For the Apoſtles kept it with themſelves. As in the inceſtuous Corinthian is manifeſt, whom <hi>Paul</hi> by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was faine to excommunicate.

               <p>On the other ſide it is argued,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. That which Chriſt doth preſuppoſe as being in many, and to be exerciſed by many, that never was committed by Chriſt to one, and the execution of any one. But <hi>Math.</hi> 18. Chriſt doth manifeſtly ſuppoſe the power of iuriſdiction to be in many, and that <hi>exercitativè,</hi> ſo as by them being many, is it to be exerciſed. Ergo. Now this is plain in the place. Where firſt marke, that Chriſt doth preſuppoſe the authoritie of every particular Church taken indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly. For it is ſuch a Church as any brother offended may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently complaine to. Therefore no univerſall, or provinciall, or Dioceſan Church gathered in a Councell. Secondly, it is not any particular Church that he doth ſend all Chriſtians to, for then all Chriſtians in the world ſhould come to one perticular Church, were
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2189:47"/>
it poſſible. He doth therefore preſuppoſe indiſtinctly the very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churh where the brother offending and offended are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And if they be not both of one church, the plaintife muſt make his denuntiation to the Church where the defendant is, <hi>quia forum ſequitur reum.</hi> Thirdly, as Chriſt doth ſpeak it of any ordinarie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church indiſtinctly, ſo he doth by the name of Church not underſtand eſſentially all the congregation. For then Chriſt ſhould give not ſome, but all the members of the Church to be governors of it. Fourthly, Chriſt ſpeaketh it of ſuch a Church to whom wee may ordinarily and orderlie complaine: now this we cannot to the whole multitude. Fiftly, this Church he ſpeaketh of, he doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe it as the ordinarie executioner of all diſcipline and cenſure. But the multitude have not this execution ordinarie, as all but <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius,</hi> and ſuch Democritall ſpirits doe affirme. And the reaſon ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the ſentence of the Church, doth ſhew that often the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it is but ſmall: <hi>For where two or three are gathered together in my name</hi> Whereas the Church or congregations eſſentiallie taken for teachers and people, are incomparably great. Neither doth Chriſt meane by Church, the chiefe Paſtor, who is virtuallie as the whole Church. For firſt, the word Church doth ever ſignifie a company, and never is found to note out one perſon. Secondlie, the Biſhop may be the perſon offending or offended, and the Church to which he muſt bring the matter, muſt be other then himſelfe. Thirdlie, the gradation doth ſhew it. Firſt, by thy ſelfe, <hi>Then ſhew a witnes or two. Then to the Church,</hi> as the ſinne increaſeth, the number of thoſe by whom it is to be rebuked and cenſured, increaſeth alſo. If one ſay, though the Church ſignifie one governour, yet the gradation hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, for to tell it to the governour in open Court, is more then to tell it to twentie. Wee grant that this is true, and were the word Church taken here to note ſome eminent governour, it might be brought in as a further degree, though one onely were enforced. But how can <hi>Peter</hi> be complainaint, if <hi>Peter</hi> the Praeful onely be the iudge to whom the thing muſt be denounced. Fourthlie, the church in the Corinthians which <hi>Paul</hi> ſtirreth up to cenſure the inceſtuous perſon, was not any one but many. Their rebuke upon which it is like hee repented, was a rebuke of many, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. Fiftly, if the church had been one, he would not have ſubjoined: <hi>for what ye ſhall bind on earth ſhall be bound in heaven.</hi> Sixtly, if the church did not note an aſſembly, how could he aſſure them from hence, <hi>that God would do what they <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ed on, becauſe he was with the leaſt aſſemblies gathered in his name.</hi> Vnleſſe the Church meant were an aſſemblie, this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not be ſo correſpondent. Where two or two or three are aſſembled in Gods name, God is in the midſt of them to doe that they agree on. But where the Church is binding or looſing, there
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2189:47"/>
are ſome aſſembled in the name of Chriſt. Ergo. Laſtly, the church in the old Teſtament never noteth the high Prieſt virtuallie, but an aſſemblie of Prieſts ſitting together, as iudges in the cauſes of God. Wherefore as Chriſt doth indiſtinctlie preſuppoſe everie particular Church. So he doth here onely preſuppoſe the joynt authoritie, &amp; joynt execution of a repreſentative Church, a Preſbyterie of Elders who were Paſtors and Governours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Wee argue from the practiſe of the Churches. That power which is not in one, nor to be exerciſed by one, but in many, and to be exerciſed by many in the Church of the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that power with the exerciſe of it, was committed by Chriſt to many, not to one. But the power of Eccleſiaſticall cenſure was in many, and to be performed by many aſſembled. Ergo. The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is plaine. For <hi>Paul</hi> would not have called for, nor have liked any conſtitution or exerciſe of power Eccleſiaſticall, other then Chriſt had ordained. The aſſertion is denied by ſome: but it is a plain truth by many invincible arguments. For firſt, <hi>Paul</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them that they had not ſet themſelves to caſt him forth. Now (as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith on the place. <hi>Si autem quis poteſtatem non habet, quem ſcit reum abjicere, aut probare non valet, immunis eſt.</hi> Secondlie, <hi>Paul</hi> doth wiſh them aſſembled together, with himſelfe in the name and vertue of Chriſt, that they might deliver him up to Sathan. For he doth not call on them to reſtrain him him as already excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, but to purge him out as an infectuous leaven yet amongſt them. Thirdlie, <hi>Paul</hi> doth tell them that they had power to judge thoſe within, thoſe who were called brethren, and lived otherwiſe. Fourthly, <hi>Paul</hi> doth tell them that they did a rebuke or mulct of many, writing to them that they would not proceed, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Paul</hi> doth attribute power to them to forgive him, and to receive him to the peace of the church. Which would not have been in them, had they not had the power to excommunicate. Such as have no power to bind, have no power to looſe. So it might be proved by the Church of the Theſſalonians, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.14. <hi>If any man walk inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninatly, note him, that others may refraine him.</hi> Noting, being not a ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by letter, which doth wreſt the word againſt all copies, and the current of al Greek interpreters: but judicially to note him, that all may avoyd him; that is, excomunicate him. Finallie, the churches of Aſia, as it is plain, had power of government within themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. That power which the Apoſtles did not exerciſe in the Churches, nor Evangeliſts, but with concurrence of the Churches and Preſbyteries, that power is much leſſe to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by any ordinary Paſtour, but by manie. But they did not ordaine, nor lay on hands alone, they did not determine queſtions by the power of the keyes alone, but with cocurrence of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of the Church. Ergo, much leſſe may any ordinarie
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2189:48"/>
miniſter doe it alone. <hi>Timothy</hi> received grace by the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Preſbyterie. For that Perſons muſt bee underſtood here is apparant by the like place; when it is ſaid, by the laying on of my hands, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> noteth a perſon, and ſo here a Preſbyterie. Secondly, to take <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to ſignifie the order of Prieſthood, is againſt all Lexicous, and the nature of the Greeke termination. Thirdly, <hi>Timothy</hi> neuer received that order of a Preſbyter, as before we have proved. Fourthly, it cannot ſignifie as Greeke Expoſiters take it, a company of Biſhops. For neither was that Canon of 3 Biſhops, and the Metropolitan, or all the Biſhops in a Province, in the Apoſtles time, neither were theſe who are now called Biſhops, then called Preſbyters, as they ſay, but Apoſtles, men that had received Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick grace, Angels, &amp;c. Finally, it is very abſurd to think of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies of other Preſbyters in Churches then <hi>Paul</hi> planted; but hee placed Preſbyteries of ſuch Preſbyters as are now diſtinguiſhed from Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, which is the grant of our adverſaries. Not to mention how <hi>Armachanus</hi> doth cenſure the other as an interpretation from ones privat ſence, beſides teſtimonie of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Thus the Apoſtles did not offer alone to determine the queſtion Act. 15. but had the joynt ſuffrages of the Preſbyterie with them. Not becauſe they could not alone haue infallibly anſwered, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a thing to be determined by many; all who had received power of the keyes, doing it <hi>ex officio,</hi> and others from diſcretion and dutie of confeſſion the truth. Yea the Biſhops called <hi>primi Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> had no ordination at the firſt which the Preſbyterie did not give them. Whence have Biſhops of other Churches power to miniſter the ſacrament to the Biſhop of this Church? But <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> are ſayd to have ordained miniſters. As Conſuls and Dictators are ſayd to have created Conſuls, becauſe they called Senates, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and together with others did it. No otherwiſe doe Ieſuits themſelves underſtand it. <hi>Salmeron</hi> on the firſt of <hi>Titus, &amp;c.</hi> And it is manifeſt by Eccleſiaſticall writings of all ſorts, that Preſbyters had right of ſuffrage, not onely in their owne Preſbyteries, but in Provinciall Synods, and therfore in Oecumenicall Synods, which doth ariſe from a combination of the other, to which their mindes went in the inſtruction of Biſhops received from their Churches. And <hi>Atbanaſius</hi> yet a Deacon, is read to have been at the Councell of Nice, and to have had right of ſuffrage in it. Finally, the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries did a long time execute joyntly all actions of Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as is before declared. Other arguments we ſhall touch in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of theſe which have been objected. Now to come to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, let this be firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 1. Extraordinarie power was committed to ſome ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

perſons, ſo that in ſome caſe they might ſingularly exerciſe it without concurrence of other. This I ſpeak in regard of Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, whoſe power in many things could not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of particular Churches, which in the former queſtion is ſufficiently declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 2. That ordinarie power, and the execution thereof was not committed to any ſingular governors; whereof there was to be one onely in each Church. This is againſt the Ieſuits, who make account (the moſt of them) <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat as all civill power of government is given to kings to be executed by them within their common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, ſo Eccleſiaſticall power (ſay they) is given to the Pope and to Biſhops in their particular Churches to be executed by them, and derived from them to the whole Church.</p>

                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 3. Ordinarie power with the execution thereof, was not given to the communitie of the Church, or to the whole multitude of the faithfull, ſo that they were the immediate and firſt receptacle, receiving it from Chriſt, and virtually deriving it to others. This I ſet downe againſt the Divines of Conſtance; our prime Divines, as <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and the Sorboniſts, who doe maintaine it at this day. Yea this ſeemeth to have been <hi>Tertullians</hi> errour; for in his booke: <hi>de pudicitia,</hi> he maketh Chriſt to haue left all Chriſtians with like power, but the Church for her honor, did diſpoſe it as we ſee. The proportion of a pollitick body, and naturall, deceived them, while they will apply all that is in theſe to Chriſts myſticall body, not remembring that <hi>analogon</hi> is not <hi>in omni ſimile,</hi> for then ſhould ſhould it be the ſame with the <hi>analogatum.</hi> True it is, all civill power is in the body politicke, the collections of ſubjects, then in a King from them; And all the power of hearing, ſeeing, they are in the whole man, which doth produce them effectually, though formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inſtrumentally they are in the care and eye. But the reaſon of this is, becauſe theſe powers are naturall, and what ever is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, doth firſt agree to the communitie or <hi>totum,</hi> and afterward to a particular perſon and part, but all that is in this body, cannot hold in Chriſts myſticall body. In a politick body, power is firſt in the communitie, in the King from them, but all Eccleſiaſticall power is firſt in our King before any in the Church from him. But to whom ſhould he firſt commit this power, but to his Queene. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering this power is not any Lordly power, but a power of doing ſervice to the Church for Chriſt his ſake. Therfore it is fit it ſhould be committed to ſome perſons, and not to the whole communitie which are the Queen of Chriſt. For it is not fit a King ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit power to his Queene to ſerve herſelfe properly: but to haue perſons who in regard of this relation ſhould ſtand diſtinguiſhed from her. Secondly, in naturall bodies, the power of ſeeing is firſt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2189:49"/>
immediatly in the man, from the man in the eye and particular members: In the myſticall body, the faith of a beleever is not firſt immediatly in all, then in the beleever, but firſt of all and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly in the perſonall beleever, for whoſe good it ſerveth more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly then for the whole, every man being to live by his own faith. The power of Prieſthood was not firſt in the Church of Iſraell, ſo derived to the Prieſt: but immediatly from Chriſt ſeated in <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes. <hi>Obiect.</hi> Yea they were given the Church <hi>intuitu e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſdem tanquam finis &amp; totius. Anſw.</hi> I but this is not enough, that power may be ſayd to be immediatly received by the Church as the firſt receptacle of it, and from it derived to others, as the power of ſeeing is not onely given <hi>intuitu hominis</hi> as the end of it, and the <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> to whom it agreeth, but is <hi>in homine</hi> as the firſt ſubiect from whom it commeth to the eye. But the power even of ordinary mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters is not in the Church. For as all are ſayd not to have been Apoſtles, ſo not to have been Doctors. But if the power of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie teaching had been given to every beleever, all ſhould have been made Doctors, though not to continue ſo in exerciſing the power. Secondly, were the power in the Church, the Church ſhould not onely call them, but make them out of vertue and power received into her ſelfe: then ſhould the Church have a true Lordlike power in regard of her miniſters. Beſides, there are many in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Chriſtians uncapable of this power regularly, as women and children. This concluſion in my judgment <hi>Victoria, Soto</hi> &amp; others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, with greater ſtrength of reaſon then the contrary is maintained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 4. Fourthly, ordinary power of miniſteriall government is committed with the execution of it, to the Senat or Preſbyterie of the Church. If any faile in any office, the Church hath not power of ſupplying that, but a miniſtery of calling one whom Chriſt hath deſcribed, that from Chriſt he may have power of office given him in the place vacant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 5. Laſtly, though the communitie have not power given her, yet ſuch eſtate by Chriſt her huſband is put on her, that all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is to be executed in ſuch manner, as ſtandeth with reſpect to her excellencie. Hence it is, that the governours are in many things of greater moment to take the conſent of the people with them. Not that they have ioynt power of the keyes with them, but becauſe they ſuſtaine the perſon of the ſpouſe of Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be otherwiſe dealt with, without open diſhonor in ſuch things, which belong in common to the whole congregation.</p>
               <p>Now to anſwer the arguments firſt propounded.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition of the firſt Syllogiſme is denyed. <hi>That what was committed to the Church was committed to ſome principall member.</hi> And we deny the ſecond part of the next Syllogiſme, proving this part
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2189:49"/>
denyed. <hi>For the power and execution was committed to a Church in a Church.</hi> Which is ſo farre from abſurditie, that he is abſurd who doth not ſee it in Civill and Sacred. Doe we not ſee in Parliament a repreſentatiue Common-wealth within our Common-wealth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the greateſt authority? Not to mention that a Church within a Church ſhould not be ſtrange to them who imagine many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhionall Churches within one Dioceſan Church. To the proofes which prevent as it were an objection, ſhewing that the Church, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.17. may be put for one chiefe Governour.</p>
               <p>The propoſition is denyed. <hi>Jf that Peter one Governour, may be in type and figure the Church to whom the juriſdiction is promiſed, then the Church receiving and executing it may be one.</hi> A moſt falſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe contrary is true. The reaſon is, becauſe the Church typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Peter</hi> is properly and really a Church, not figuratiuely and improperly: for then <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould haue bene a figure or type, of a type or figuratiue Church. The figure therfore and type being of the Church which is properly taken, and the Church properly and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, being a company aſſembled, hence it is that (<hi>Math.</hi> 18.17.) the Church cannot ſignifie one; for one is but figuratiuely and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly a Church. There is not the ſame reaſon of the figure and the thing that is figured. Nay hence an Argument may be retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, proving that by that Church whereof <hi>Peter</hi> was a figure, is not meant one chiefe Governour. <hi>Peter</hi> as one man or Governour was properly and really a virtuall Church and chiefe Governour. But <hi>Peter</hi> as one man and Governour was in figure onely the Church. <hi>Math.</hi> 18. Ergo, that Church <hi>Math.</hi> 18. is not a virtuall Church, noting forth one chiefe Governour onely. As for <hi>Cyprians</hi> ſpeech, it doth nothing but ſhew the conjunction of Paſtor and people by mutuall loue, which is ſo ſtreight that the one cannot be ſchiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally left out, but the other is forſaken alſo. Otherwiſe I thinke it cannot be ſhewed to the time of <hi>Innocentius</hi> 3. that the Biſhop was counted the Church; or this dreame of a virtuall Church once ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. The Clerkes of the Church of <hi>Placentia</hi> did in their oath of canonicall obedience ſweare thus: <hi>That they would obey the Church of Placentia, and the Lord their Biſhop.</hi> Where the Chapiter doth carrie the name of the Church from the Biſhop. Yea, even in thoſe times prepoſed, or ſet before him, when the Pope was lifted up aboue generall Councels, then it is like was the firſt nativity of theſe virtuall Churches. As for a Kingdom I doubt not, but it may be put for a King figuratiuely: but the Church typified by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> muſt needs be a Church properly. And it will never be proved that any one Governour was ſet up in a Church proportionable to a King in a Common-wealth, in whom is all civill power wherby the whole Kingdom is adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:2189:50"/>To the ſecond Argument from the Apoſtles fact in the Church of Corinth, who judicially (abſent) ſentenced his excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>I haue decreed or judged,</hi> leaving nothing to the Church, but out of their obedience to decline him, as in the 2. Epiſt. 2. he ſaith, <hi>For this cauſe I haue written to you, that I may prooue whether you will in all things be obedient.</hi> What Arguments are theſe? He that jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth one to be excommunicated, he leaveth no place for the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Church of Corinth judicially to excommunicate. Thus I might reaſon, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.17. from <hi>Iames,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. He who doth judicially ſentence a thing he leaveth no place to other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Preſbyters to giue ſentence. The truth is, the Apoſtle might haue judged him to be excommunicate; and an Euangeliſt, if preſent, might haue judged him alſo to be excommunicate, and yet place left for the Churches judgement alſo. Theſe are ſubordinate one to the other. Here it may be objected, that if place be left for the Churches judgement after the Apoſtles ſentence; then the Church is free not to excommunicate where the Apoſtles haue, and the ſame man ſhould be excommunicate and not excommunicate. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Suppoſe the Apoſtles could excommunicate <hi>Clave errante</hi> without cauſe, it is true. But the Apoſtles ſentence being juſt, ſhee is not free, in as much as ſhe cannot lawfully but doe that which lyeth on her; when now it is eſpecially ſhewed her, and by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhe is provoked. Yea, where ſhe ſhould ſee juſt cauſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating ſhe is not (though none call on her) free not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate. Nevertheleſſe, though ſhe is not free, ſo as ſhe can lawfully not excommunicate, yet ſhe is free ſpeaking, of freedome abſolutely and ſimply, and if ſhe ſhould not excommunicate him, he ſhould remaine not excommunicable but excommunicate, by chiefe judgement, yet it ſhould not be executed, by the ſiniſter fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a particular Church, As, ſay <hi>Sauls</hi> ſentence had been juſt, and the peoples favour had been unjuſt, <hi>Ionathan</hi> had been under condemnation, but execution had been prevented by the peoples headſtrong affection towards him. <hi>Ob.</hi> So they who obeyed <hi>Paul</hi> they did not judicially excommunicate. <hi>Anſ.</hi> As though one may not exerciſe power or government by manner of obedience to the exhortation of a ſuperiour. Touching the place in the <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> thoſe that read. <hi>Note him by an Epiſtle,</hi> doe goe againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all Greek Interpreters. And the context doth ſhew, that it is a judiciary noting one, ſuch as cauſed him to be avoided by others, and tended to breed ſhame in him. As for <hi>Paules</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> It will not follow. That which he did alone an ordinary Paſtor may doe alone. Secondly, it is not like he did it alone: but as he caſt out the Corinthian, though the whole proceeding be not noted. Though Paul ſaith, <hi>I delivered</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:2189:50"/>
them. So he ſaith, grace was given <hi>Timothy</hi> by impoſition of his hands, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6 when yet the Preſbyterie ioyned, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. Thirdly, it may be they were no fixed members in any conſtituted Church.</p>
               <p>The third argument of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> hath been ſufficiently diſcuſſed.</p>
               <p>To the fourth, <hi>That one is fitter for execution then many.</hi> To which we may adde, that though the Biſhops be but as Conſuls in a Senat, or Vice-chancellors in a univerſitie, having when they ſit with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, no more power then the reſt. Yet theſe have execution of many things committed to them. The aſſertion, viz. <hi>That many are leſſe fit for execution,</hi> we deny. That order is fitteſt which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted. But he doth commit the keyes to the Church, to many, that they might exerciſe the authoritie of them; when that mean is moſt fit, which God will moſt bleſſe, and his bleſſing doth follow his own order; this is the fittteſt. Secondly, in the Apoſtles times, and in the times after, almoſt foure hundred yeares expired, Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did continue with Biſhops in governing and executing what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was decreed. Thirdly, this depravation from the firſt order, one to execute for a Dioceſan, one for a Provinciall, the decrees of a Dioceſan and Provinciall, drew on a neceſſitie of one to execute the decrees of the Oecumenicall Church or Pope. Fourthly, Let them ſhew where God divided the power of making lawes for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Church from the power to execute them. Regularly they who have the greater committed, have the leſſer alſo. Fiftly, we ſee even in civill governments many parts by ioynt Councell and action are as happily governed as others are by a ſingular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. Truely, that the Affrican Fathers write to <hi>Celeſtine</hi> is true: <hi>It is unlikely that God will be preſent with one, inſſpiring him with his ſpirit, and not be preſent with many who are in his name, and with his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant aſſembled.</hi> As for thoſe compariſons they hold not in all: they hold in that which the Conſull doth in calling the aſſembly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding things, &amp;c. Yet the Conſuls never took the power to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their fellowes without the concurrence of their fellow Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, nor to withdraw themſelves from being ſubiect to the cenſure of the reſt of the Senate.</p>
               <p>To the fift argument, to the propoſition by diſtinction: if they have all power both of miniſteriall application, and inſtituting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of vertue and authoritie, then Paſtours derive. But this is denyed. She hath no power but of Miniſterie, and no plenitude but ſo farre as they in their own perſons can diſcharge. It preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth therefore we affirme in our queſtion what we doe not. But to let the propoſition paſſe, becauſe of ſome derivation, it is true. If ſhe have but all power of Miniſteriall application, then Biſhops
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2189:51"/>
derive from her. But they doe not. We ſay they doe. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is objected, that which the Church never had ſhe cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it. I anſwer, that which the Church never had ſhe cannot vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virtually convey it: but ſhe may as miniſtering to him who hath the power and vertue of deriving it. Nothing can give that which it hath not, either formally or virtually, unleſſe it give it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to one who hath it. A man not having a peny of his own, may give an hundred pounds if the king make him his Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. A Steward may give all offices in his maſters houſe, as mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially executing his maſters pleaſure. Thus the Church deriveth, as taking the perſon whom Chriſt deſcribeth, and out of power will haue placed in this or that office in his Church. This anſwereth to the laſt ſuggeſtion. For if the Church did virtually, and out of power make an officer, it is true, as wee ſee with thoſe whom the King maketh in the common-wealth. But if ſhe doe it in Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like manner, miniſtring to the ſole Lord and maſter of his houſe, then is not he ſo taken in to doe in his name, but in his maſters name. As a Butler taken in by a ſervant, doth execute his office not in maſter Stewards name, but in his maſters, who onely out of power did conferre it on him.</p>
               <p>The laſt obiection I anſwer. That the particular Church may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Biſhop. What member ſoever in the Church is the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding perſon, may be complained of to the Church. The Church of Philippi, if it had power to ſee that <hi>Archippus</hi> doe his dutie, then it had power to reprove and cenſure him not doing it. If the Church have power by election to chooſe one their Biſhop, and ſo power of inſtituting him, then of deſtituting alſo. <hi>Inſtituere &amp; deſtituere e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſdem eſt poteſtatis.</hi> But hee is given the onely iudge in Chriſts roome, and though they elect him, yet as you haue ſayd, and truly, they have not the power of that authoritie in them to which he is elected. No more then the Electors of the Emperour haue in them power of the imperiall dignitie. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Wee ſay therefore, that as the Church hath onely miniſteriall power of application, that is, as they cannot out of power call a Paſtour, but onely call one whom Chriſt poynteth out, and to whom Chriſt out of power giveth the place of Paſtour. So ſhe cannot cenſure or depoſe, but onely mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially executing the cenſure of Chriſt, who will have ſuch a one turned out, or otherwiſe cenſured. But the Biſhop never was ſole judge, though <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> he may be ſaid ſo. Chriſt inſtituted a Preſbyterie, in which all had equall power of iudgement. <hi>Cyprian Ep.</hi> 68 in the caſe of <hi>Baſilides</hi> &amp; <hi>Martialis,</hi> doth ſhew that the Church had power as of chooſing worthy, ſo of refuſing unworthy. Hee ſpeaketh of an ordinarie power, as by chooſing is manifeſt, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie and in caſe of neceſſitie. And Mr. <hi>Field</hi> maintaineth,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2189:51"/>
that <hi>Liberius</hi> was lawfully depoſed by the Church of Rome. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I marvell men of learning will deny it, when no reaſon evinceth the Pope though a generall Paſtour ſubiect to the cenſure of a Church Oecumenicall, but the ſame proveth a Dioceſan Biſhop ſubiect to the cenſure of the particular Church. Vnleſſe they will ſay with ſome Schoolmen, <hi>Soto</hi> viz. That the Pope is but the vicar of Chriſt in the generall Church: but the Biſhop is both the vicar of Chriſt, and alſo repreſenteth the generall Church in his Dioceſſe, whence he cannot be proceeded againſt by the Church that is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. As if to be a vicar of Chriſt were a leſſer matter then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Church. Secondlie, I marvell how hee commeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the generall Church, with whom in his calling the Church Oecumenicall hath nothing to doe.</p>
               <p>To that which is obiected touching Fathers, Paſtours; the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes hold not in all things. Natural parents are no wayes children, nor in ſtate of ſubiection to their children: but ſpirituall fathers are ſo fathers, that in ſome reſpect they are children to the whole Church. So ſheepheards are no wayes ſheep, but miniſters are in regard of the whole Church. Secondly, Parents and Sheepheards are abſolutelie parents and ſheepheards, bee they good or evill: but ſpirituall Parents and Paſtors are no longer ſo then they doe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly behave themſelves. Beſides, are not civil Kings Parents and Paſtors of their people? yet if they be not abſolute Monarches, it was never eſteemed as abſurd, to ſay that their people had power in ſome caſes to depoſe them. If their owne Churches have no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over them, it will be hard to ſhew wherein others haue ſuch power of iuriſdiction over perſons who belong not to their owne churches. But Lord Biſhops muſt take ſtate on them, and not ſubiect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto any triall, but by their Peeresonely, which is by a Councell of Biſhops.</p>
